4020,variable,,"Diabeta (Glyburide)",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Diabeta (Glyburide)?</strong></h2>\nDiabeta is an oral diabetes medicine that helps you control your blood sugar levels. Its common name, which is also the generic version, is Glyburide, or Glibenclamide. It is prescribed alongside proper dietary management, exercise and weight reduction for adults with type 2 diabetes, and is not for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.\n<h2><strong>How does Glyburide work?</strong></h2>\nGlyburide (Diabeta) lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin. It belongs to a large class of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic drugs</a> called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sulfonylureas</a>. These drugs bind to beta cells in your pancreas and stimulate them to release more insulin into the rest of your body.\n<h2><strong>How and when to use this medication</strong></h2>\nDiabeta is used for the treatment of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">type 2 diabetes</a>, and not for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The dose amount and dose schedule may be different for different patients. Always remember to follow your doctor’s orders or the directions on the label. You should take the tablets during or immediately after meals.\n<h2><strong>Diabeta dosage</strong></h2>\nThe usual dose for adults is between 2.5 to 10 mg taken once a day, but it can be as low as 1.25mg and as high as 20 mg. The tablets should be taken with your breakfast or with your first main meal of the day. A dose of more than 10 mg should be taken in two divided doses. Dose increases should be made in increments of no more than 2.5 mg, at weekly intervals, based upon your blood sugar response. Your doctor may adjust your dose as treatment continues, but the dose is usually not more than 20 mg per day. Dosing for children should be determined individually by your doctor.\n\nIf you are transferring from other oral diabetic treatments, you should do so conservatively, with your initial daily dose being between be 2.5 to 5 mg. When transferring from oral diabetic drugs other than Chlorpropamide, there is not usually a transition period, and you may not need an initial priming dose. When transferring from Chlorpropamide, specific care should be applied during the first two weeks because the remaining Chlorpropamide in your body, and the overlapping effects of the drug, may provoke low blood sugar levels.\n\nIf you are transferring from more than 40 daily units of insulin, you may be started on a daily dose of 5 mg along with a 50% reduction in insulin. With the progressive withdrawal of insulin, the increase of Diabeta is usually administered in increments of 1.25 to 2.5 mg every two to ten days from then onward.\n\nDaily doses that exceed 20 mg are not recommended.\n\nIf you should happen to miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. Although, if it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose and simply go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take double doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nA proper diet, exercise and weight reduction are important to help you control your diabetes. Your blood sugar may change in some situations, however. For example, if you are under stress or suffering from a certain illnesses. During such times, your doctor may need to modify your dose.\n\nDiabeta may cause low blood sugar, especially if you skip a meal, exercise strenuously, drink alcohol or take another antidiabetic medication along with Glyburide. Elderly patients may be more likely to have low blood sugar when taking this medication.\n<h3>Drugs that can interact with this medication are:</h3>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Diuretics (water pills)</li>\n 	<li>Corticosteroids (such as prednisone)</li>\n 	<li>ACE inhibitors (a drug used to treat high blood pressure or hypertension)</li>\n 	<li>Birth control pills</li>\n 	<li>Certain kinds of cold and allergy drugs</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\nAs with any type of medication, along with its medicinal effects, Diabeta is also associated with some side effects.\n<h3>Common negative effects include the following:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heartburn</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling “full”</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Abdominal pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Weight gain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic skin reactions (itchiness, rash, eruption)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Increased sensibility to light</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Visual disturbances</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Possible severe negative effects include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Blood disorders (unusual bruising or bleeding)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Liver problem (yellowing of the eyes or skin)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reaction (difficult breathing, hives, decreased blood pressure)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis)</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTalk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

Forxiga is a brand name medication. Its active ingredient is dapagliflozin, which is also the generic version of this medication. It belongs to the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-sglt2-inhibitors-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gliflozin</a> family of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic medications</a>.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nFarxiga is used to help lower blood sugar levels in <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">adults with type 2 diabetes</a>, and should not be used to treat people with type 1 diabetes, or those with diabetic ketoacidosis (an increase in ketones in your blood or urine).\n<h2><strong>How does Forxiga work?</strong></h2>\nFarxiga, like other members of the gliflozin family of antidiabetic drugs, works by decreasing the re-absorption of blood sugar back into your kidneys. With less blood sugar being absorbed back into the kidneys, more blood sugar is eliminated through your urine. This results in less sugar in your blood. Not only does it help control your blood sugar levels, but it also may also help you reduce your body weight and blood pressure.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nFarxiga is recommended to be taken in the morning, with or without food, but try to take your dose the same way each time. Always follow all the directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may change your dose from time to time in order for you to get the best results. Never take it in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than your doctor recommends.\n<h3>The medication can be used:</h3>\n<ol>\n 	<li>alone, if you cannot take <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Metformin</a>,</li>\n 	<li>with Metformin</li>\n 	<li>with a Sulfonylurea</li>\n 	<li>with Metformin and a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sulfonylurea</a></li>\n 	<li>with Sitagliptin (with or without Metformin)</li>\n 	<li>with insulin (with or without Metformin)</li>\n</ol>\nYour blood sugar will likely need to be checked often, and you may also need to get other medical tests at your doctor’s office. Farxiga is only one part of your treatment program that should also include a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight control, and regular blood sugar level monitoring.\n\nReport to your doctor about all the current medication you are taking, or any you start or stop using, especially:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Diuretics (water pills)</li>\n 	<li>Heart or blood pressure drugs</li>\n 	<li>NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and others</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Dapagliflozin Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, taken in the morning, with or without food. Your doctor may increase your dose to 10 mg once daily if you are tolerating the drug well and require additional blood sugar level control. You should have your kidney function monitored before, during and after taking the drug.\n\nIf used in combination with insulin, or any related drugs, your doctor will likely prescribe a lower dose of insulin or the related drug in order to reduce the risk of low blood sugar.\n\nIf you should happen to miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If you do not happen to remember until it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed, and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for missed doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not take this drug if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>have any allergies to dapagliflozin</li>\n 	<li>have serious kidney problems, or are currently on dialysis</li>\n 	<li>Before you take Farxiga, tell your doctor:</li>\n 	<li>all of your current, and previous medical conditions, especially problems with your kidneys, bladder, liver, or pancreas</li>\n 	<li>if you had, or have risk factors for, ketoacidosis</li>\n 	<li>if you are pregnant, or are planning on becoming pregnant</li>\n 	<li>if you are breastfeeding, or are planning to breastfeed</li>\n 	<li>about all the medication you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and supplements</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Farxiga side effects</strong></h2>\nIf you have any signs of an allergic reaction to Farxiga, immediately stop taking the medication and get emergency medical help.

Linagliptin belongs to a class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DPP-4</a>) enzyme inhibitors, whereas empagliflozin is a type of sodium-glucose co-transporter (<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-sglt2-inhibitors-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SGLT2</a>) inhibitor. Each tablet contains 5mg of linagliptin and 10mg or 25mg empagliflozin. The drug is a product of Boehringer Ingelheim, a global pharmaceutical company based in Germany.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?  </strong></h2>\nContaining both linagliptin and empagliflozin, Glyxambi is prescribed as an adjunctive therapy to improve blood glucose control in diabetic patients. For best results, this medication should be used in combination with lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary change. Conventionally, empagliflozin is indicated for reducing the risks of cardiovascular death in adult patients with a comorbidity of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus. The drug is not intended for use in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis or type I diabetes.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nTake the drug once daily in the morning. Glyxambi can be taken with or without food. While taking the drug, patients should follow all the recommendations by doctors (e.g. exercise or dietary change) for optimal treatment outcomes. If patients miss a dose of Glyxambi, they should take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, they should skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled. Patients should not double up on the dose under any circumstances. This med can be used along with other <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">anti-hyperglycemic agents</a>; however, there is a higher risk of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) when Glyxambi is used concomitantly with other diabetes medications.\n<h2><strong>How does this drug work?</strong></h2>\nThe active ingredients of Glyxambi (empagliflozin and linagliptin) work synergistically to enhance glycemic control in diabetes patients. As previously mentioned, empagliflozin is an inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) while linagliptin is known to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzymes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 is the main transporter that reabsorbs glucose from the glomerular filtrate. Through its inhibitory actions on SGLT2, empagliflozin decreases the renal reabsorption of filtered glucose, thereby lowering the renal threshold for glucose and increasing the urinary excretion of glucose. Linagliptin, on the other hand, has inhibitory actions on dipeptidyl peptidase-4. DPP-4 is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Linagliptin helps increase the concentration of active incretin hormones while promoting the insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner. at the same time, it decreases the level of glucagon in the blood circulation.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe recommended daily dose of Glyxambi (empagliflozin/linagliptin) is 10mg/5mg. If well tolerated, the dose of Glyxambi can be further increased to 25mg/5mg.\n<h2><strong>Glyxambi side effects</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Runny nose</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Stuffy nose</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Upper respiratory tract infections</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sore throat</strong></li>\n</ul>\nPlease note that this section does not contain all the potential side effects of Glyxambi. Adverse effects other than the ones in this list may occur in some patients. If symptoms persist or worsen, patients should see a doctor without delay.

Like other members of the gliflozin family of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetes-medications-list"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetes drugs</a>, this is achieved by blocking your kidney’s ability to absorb sugar from your blood. Preventing this absorption causes the excess sugar in your blood to be eliminated through your urine. The drug also increases your urination rate, thus clearing more blood sugar from your body.\n<h2><strong>How to take this diabetes medication</strong></h2>\nIt is best to take Canagliflozin before the first meal of the day and at the same time each day. You should swallow the tablet whole with water.\n<h2><strong>Canagliflozin dosage</strong></h2>\nThe recommended initial dose is 100 mg by mouth each day, with or without food. Your doctor may increase your dose to 300 mg. However, if you have problems with your kidneys your doctor may limit your dose to 100 mg a day. If you should forget to take a dose, try to take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is close to the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and stick to your usual schedule.

The tablets contain two prescription medicines, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-januvia-25-50-100-mg-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sitagliptin</a> and <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-metformin-500mg-850mg-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Metformin</a>.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nJanumet is used alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise to regulate blood sugar levels in adults with type II diabetes.\n<h2><strong>How does the drug work?</strong></h2>\nJanumet lowers your blood sugar levels by helping your pancreas make more insulin, helping your body more effectively use the insulin that it makes, and helping to decrease excess sugar that your liver makes. Each tablet contains a combination of two antidiabetic drugs, Sitagliptin and Metformin. These two medicines work together to help you better regulate your blood sugar levels. Sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DPP-4 inhibitors</a> (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), which help improve your level of insulin when your blood sugar level is too high, especially after a meal. Sitagliptin also helps you decrease the amount of sugar made by your body and is unlikely to cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), a common side effect of antidiabetic drugs. Metformin belongs to a group of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-biguanides-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">biguanides</a>, and it helps you lower the amount of sugar made by your liver. Together, these medicines help you to achieve your goal of better blood sugar control.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\n<strong>The drug can be taken</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>alone, if you are not already taking Metformin or any combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin.</li>\n 	<li>in combination with a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sulfonylurea drug</a> if you are not already taking Metformin with a Sulfonylurea medication.</li>\n 	<li>with a premixed or long-to-intermediate-acting insulin.</li>\n 	<li>in combination with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-pioglitazone-15-30-45-mg/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pioglitazone</a> if you are not already taking Metformin and Pioglitazone.</li>\n</ul>\nJanumet should be taken with meals to lower your chance of having an upset stomach. Swallow the tablets whole, without breaking or cutting the tablets before swallowing. Continue to take it for as long as your doctor tells you. It is important not to miss any doses.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nDosing can be different for different people. Make sure that you take your medicine exactly as your doctor prescribed it to you. Your dose will most likely be individualized to you, based on your current lifestyle, your tolerability, and the drug’s effectiveness.\n\nThe maximum recommended dose is Metformin 2000mg and Sitagliptin 100mg, taken orally, every day. If you are currently not being treated with Metformin, a typical dose is 500mg of Metformin and 50mg of Sitagliptin, orally, twice a day. If you are currently being treated with metformin, a typical dose is 50mg of Sitagliptin with your current Metformin dose, taken orally, twice a day. 1000Mg of Metformin and 50mg of Sitagliptin, taken orally, twice a day is recommended for people who are already taking a high daily dose of Metformin.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<strong>Before you begin taking Janumet, tell your doctor if you</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have or have had pancreatitis (inflammation of your pancreas).</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had severe kidney problems.</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had liver problems.</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had heart problems, including congestive heart failure.</li>\n 	<li>Drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in a short-term (“binge” drinking).</li>\n 	<li>Need to get an injection of dye or contrast agents for an imaging or scanning procedure.

4056,variable,,Januvia,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Januvia (Sitagliptin)?</strong></h2>\nJanuvia is a once-a-day prescription drug that, alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise, helps to lower blood sugar in adults that have type 2 diabetes. Its chemical, or generic name is Sitagliptin. Your doctor may refer to Januvia as Sitagliptin, Januvia's generic name.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nJanuvia is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but not type 1 diabetes. It is prescribed either alone or in combination with other <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">oral antidiabetic drugs</a> in order to help improve blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>How does this medication work?</strong></h2>\nJanuvia is a member of a group of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"">DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors)</a>. It works by blocking enzymes that breakdown important hormones involved in eating, appetite and digestion. These hormones play a large role in regulating blood sugar levels. When the breakdown of these hormones is blocked it allows the pancreas to increase the amount of insulin production, and also decrease the amount of glucagon production, which normally increases your blood sugar levels. As your blood sugar levels begin returning to normal, the effects on of insulin and glucagon slowly diminishes, which prevents an “overshoot” that can lead to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) which is often seen with other oral antidiabetic drugs.\n<h2><strong>How to take Sitagliptin</strong></h2>\nJanuvia should be taken once daily, as your doctor tells you. You may take your medicine with or without food. You might also be required by your doctor to do blood tests from time to time to see how your kidneys are working. Your dose may be changed by your doctor based on the results of your blood tests. Your doctor might also ask you to take it along with other diabetes medicines. <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hypoglycemia</a> or low blood sugar can occur more often when it is used with certain other diabetes medicines.\n\nIf you should happen to miss a dosage, make sure that you take it as soon as you can. If you don’t remember until it is almost time for your next dosage, skip that missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Never take two doses at the same time to make up for any missed doses.\n<h2><strong>Januvia Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe recommended dose of is 100 mg once daily, and can be taken with or without food.\n\nFor patients with mild kidney insufficiency no dosage adjustment for is required. For patients with moderate kidney insufficiency the dose is lowered to 50 mg once daily. For patients with severe kidney insufficiency or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which requires hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose lowered to 25 mg once daily. It may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.\n\nWhen it is used in combination with insulin, or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">sulfonylurea</a>), a smaller dose of insulin or the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/what-are-insulin-secretagogues-types-benefits-side-effects.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">insulin secretagogue</a> might be required to reduce the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nAs with most drugs prescribed for the treatment of diabetes, Januvia should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diabetic ketoacidosis</a> (increased ketones in the urine or blood). You should not use it if you are allergic to sitagliptin.\n\nCases of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) which may be severe and lead to death have been reported in some patients. Cases of a skin condition called bullous pemphigoid that may require hospital treatment have also been reported in some people.

4061,variable,,Jardiance,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Jardiance (Empagliflozin)?</strong></h2>\nJardiance is an oral diabetes medicine that can help you regulate your blood sugar levels better. Its chemical, or generic version is Empagliflozin, and it belongs to the larger <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-sglt2-inhibitors-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gliflozin</a> family of antidiabetic medications. Along with the other members of the gliflozin family, it works by helping your kidneys get rid of excess glucose from your bloodstream.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nJardiance is used along with a healthy diet and regular exercise to help improve and regulate blood sugar level control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n<h2><strong>How does Empagliflozin work?</strong></h2>\nEmpagliflozin (Jardiance), like other members of the gliflozin family of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hypoglycemic drugs</a>, works to lower blood sugar levels by increasing the amount of sugar that is eliminated from the body through your urine. These drugs are designed to block your kidney’s ability to re-absorb sugar from your blood. When this re-absorption is prevented in your kidneys, your blood sugar levels will drop as glucose begins to be eliminated through your urine. Also, it increases your overall rate of urination, so even more blood sugar is eliminated from your body, causing your blood sugar levels to stabilize.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nAlways remember to follow the directions given to you by your doctor. Jardiance is recommended to be taken once a day, at any time of the day, by mouth, and with or without food. Swallow the tablets whole, and do not cut or divide the tablets up.\n<h2><strong>Jardiance Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe usual, recommended adult starting dose of Jardiance is one 10 mg tablet a day. Your doctor may increase your dose to one 25 mg tablet per day if you need to further control your blood sugar level.\n<h3>Missed Doses</h3>\nNever take a double dose. If it is 12 hours or more until it is time for your next dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the normal time. If it is fewer than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose, and then take your next dose at the normal time.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not take the drug if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>are allergic to empagliflozin, or any of the other ingredients</li>\n 	<li>have <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-1-diabetes-symptoms-causes-treatments"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">type 1 diabetes</a> (a diabetic condition in which your body does not produce any insulin)</li>\n 	<li>have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, a complication of diabetes) or a history of DKA</li>\n 	<li>have a severe kidney condition or you are on dialysis</li>\n 	<li>have severe liver disease</li>\n 	<li>are pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant.

It will cause your urine to test positive for sugar (glucose). It may cause changes in your cholesterol or fat levels in your blood.\n\nIt may also cause abnormal kidney function. Your doctor will do blood tests to monitor how well you are tolerating the drug and how well your kidneys are working. Jardiance also increases the chance of getting a yeast infection of the penis or vagina. This is more likely in people who have had yeast infections in the past. It may also cause lightheadedness or dizziness. Do not drive or operate machines until you are confident you know how the medicine affects you personally.\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\nIn addition to its therapeutic effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by Jardiance.

4065,variable,,Jentadueto,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Jentadueto?</strong></h2>\nJentadueto is a medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that contains two prescription drugs, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-tradjenta-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Linagliptin</a> and <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-metformin-500mg-850mg-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Metformin</a>. Linagliptin is a member of a family of drugs called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"">dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors</a>, which work to help you lower your blood sugar levels. Metformin is a member of a family of drugs called biguanides, which help to decrease the amount of sugar made by your liver and help your cells to respond to insulin.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nJentadueto is generally prescribed along with a healthy diet and regular exercise to help improve the regulation of blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.\n<h3>It is prescribed for patients:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>who are not controlled on Metformin alone</li>\n 	<li>currently on Linagliptin (Trajenta) and Metformin alone</li>\n 	<li>who use a combination drug with a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">sulfonylurea</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nJentadueto is a medication that contains two antidiabetic drugs, Linagliptin and Metformin. Linagliptin belongs to a group of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors for short. They help you control blood sugar by blocking the breakdown of hormones that are involved with your appetite, your eating habits, and how your body digests food. More importantly, these hormones affect how your body regulates blood sugar levels. When the medication slows the breakdown of these hormones, your pancreas will start to increase <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/organ-human-body-produces-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">insulin production</a>. Linagliptin also decreases production of glucagon in the pancreas, which can increase your blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar levels start to return to normal, the effects of insulin and glucagon slowly diminishes. This stops your medication from causing low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, which is a common side effect in many <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">oral hypoglycemic drugs</a>.\n\nMetformin belongs to the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-biguanides-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">biguanide</a> class of antidiabetic drugs, and its main effect is a decrease in sugar production that occurs in your liver. It also increases your body’s sensitivity to insulin, which increases the ability for your body to process sugar. Mainly, Metformin decreases high blood sugar by slowing sugar production in your liver, which is medically known as hepatic gluconeogenesis. An average patient with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of heptic gluconeogenesis, and with Metformin treatment it has been shown to reduce this by over one-third. Besides decreasing liver sugar production, Metformin also decreases the absorption of blood sugar from your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nBefore taking this drug, your doctor should assess your kidney function with what is called an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Once you are prescribed Jentadueto, it is taken once daily with a meal. Make sure to swallow the tablet whole. Do not split, crush, dissolve, or chew the tablet.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe usual adult dose is 2.5 mg (Linagliptin) and 500 mg (Metformin), or 2.5/850 mg, or 2.5/1000 mg, twice daily, taken with meals. Take the Jentadueto tablet with meals to lower your chance of getting an upset stomach. Make sure to not exceed a total daily dose of Linagliptin 5 mg and Metformin 2000 mg.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>You should not take this medication if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>are allergic (hypersensitive) to Linagliptin, Metformin or any of the other non-medicinal ingredients</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>had, or have liver or kidney problems</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>have a history of lactic acidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>have metabolic acidosis or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diabetic ketoacidosis</a> (increased ketones in the blood or urine)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>have upcoming x-ray tests that require the injection of dyes or contrast agents</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>are highly stressed, have severe infections, are experiencing trauma, are prior to a surgery or have recently had surgery</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>have cardiovascular collapse (abrupt failure of blood circulation) or cardiorespiratory insufficiency</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>are dehydrated (a reduction in the amount of body fluids).

Symptoms of lactic acidosis include feeling sick, myalgias (muscle pain), somnolence (drowsiness), respiratory distress, and abdominal pain.\n\nRisk factors for lactic acidosis include kidney impairment, the use of other drugs at the same time, being older than 65, imagery studies with the use of a contrast dye, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, and excessive alcohol intake.\n<h3>Common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Stuffy nose or runny nose and sore throat (nasopharyngitis)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea, nausea, and stomach upset, bloating, flatulence&gt;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reactions, such as hives, rash, and swelling of the lips, face, and throat, or coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Pancreatitis (inflammation or infection of the pancreas)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lactic Acidosis, a build-up of lactic acid in the blood that can cause death</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Mouth ulceration</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf you take Jentadueto with other medications that can cause low blood sugar, such as sulfonylurea drugs, you have a higher risk of having low blood sugar. Call your doctor if you have any symptoms of low blood sugar. You should first check your blood sugar levels and after treating them, call your doctor. Symptoms of low blood sugar level can include shaking, sweating, rapid heartbeat, change in vision, hunger, headache and change in mood.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Boehringer Ingelheim",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"Hypoglycemic > DPP-4",,"Dry Shipping",https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jentadueto.png,,,,,,,,,0,,product/buy-jentadueto-online,Jentadueto,"2.5 mg/500 mg, 2.5 mg/850 mg, 2.5 mg/1000 mg",1,0,no,no,no,1,1,no,148,30,"Order Jentadueto tablets at LOW PRICES with affordable U.S. shipping from Canadianinsulin.com - Your source for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes medication online.",on,,"Buy Jentadueto Drugs Online From Canada | Low Cost",2021-08-10T21:24:39+00:00,,,2,,,,

4074,simple,,"Komboglyze 2.5 mg / 1000 mg",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 60 tablets x 2.5 mg/1000mg each</h3>","<h2><strong>What is Komboglyze?</strong></h2>\nKomboglyze is an oral <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic medication</a> that contains a combination of two prescription antidiabetic drugs; <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-onglyza-2.5mg-5mg-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Saxagliptin</a> and <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Metformin</a>. They work together to control your blood sugar levels. Saxagliptin belongs to a family of medications called DPP-4 inhibitors, and Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication that belongs to the biguanide family of antidiabetic drugs that are used to lower your blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nKomboglyze is prescribed for the improvement of blood sugar level control in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is typically used alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise to help improve blood sugar levels in adult diabetics who are already being treated with:\n<ul>\n 	<li>a combination of Saxagliptin and Metformin, or Metformin and another drug</li>\n 	<li>Saxagliptin, Metformin and another <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sulfonylurea drug</a></li>\n 	<li>Saxagliptin, Metformin and insulin</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nKomboglyze contains a combination of two prescription antidiabetic medications, Saxagliptin and Metformin.\n\nAs mentioned above, saxagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">DPP-4 inhibitors</a>, which stands for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Saxagliptin helps to improve your blood sugar levels after a meal. It prevents the breakdown of important hormones involved in eating, appetite and digestion. These hormones play a large role in regulating blood sugar levels, and when the breakdown of these hormones is blocked it allows the pancreas to increase the amount of insulin production. It also decreases glucagon production in the pancreas, which normally would increase your blood sugar level. Saxagliptin also lowers blood sugar levels between meals and helps to decrease the amount of sugar made by your body.\n\nMetformin is a member of the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-biguanides-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">biguanide class of medicines</a>, which helps you lower the amount of sugar made by your liver. It also increases insulin sensitivity, which increases your body’s absorption and processing of sugar in your blood. In addition to decreasing liver sugar production while increasing insulin sensitivity, Metformin enhances peripheral blood sugar absorption and decreases absorption of blood sugar from the gastrointestinal tract.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nAlways follow the directions given to you by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take and how often you need to take them. Kombogylze is generally taken twice a day along with meals to reduce the stomach upset that Metformin can cause.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nMany things can change the dose of medication that a you need, such as body weight, other medical conditions and other medications. If your doctor has recommended a different dose from the ones listed here, do not change the way that you are taking the medication without consulting your doctor first. It is very important that you take this medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\n\nThe recommended daily dose of Kombogylze is based on the dose needed to effectively regulate your blood sugar levels and how well you tolerate the side effects. A typical beginning dose for adults who have not been taking Saxagliptin is the same dose of the Metformin you are taking along with 2.5mg saxagliptin, taken twice a day. If you are changing from taking Saxagliptin and Metformin individually, you might be prescribed the saxagliptin-metformin amount that you have been currently taking. The maximum recommend daily dose is 5mg Saxagliptin and 2000mg metformin.\n\nIf you should happen to miss a dose, take it as soon as you can, with food, and go back to your normal dosing schedule. If you do not remember until it is nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and stick to your normal dosing schedule. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you are not sure what to do after you miss a dose, contact your doctor for advice.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<strong>Some drugs may interact with Kombogylze, so tell your doctor if you are taking:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Other diabetes drugs, such as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-diabeta-glyburide-2.5mg-5mg/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Glyburide</a></li>\n 	<li>Furosemide</li>\n 	<li>Nifedipine</li>\n 	<li>Cationic drugs (e.g. digoxin, amiloride, procainamide, morphine, quinine, quinidine, triamterene, ranitidine, vancomycin and trimethoprim)</li>\n 	<li>Other drugs that may cause hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and may lead to a loss of blood sugar control</li>\n 	<li>ACE inhibitor drugs (may lower blood glucose)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Do not take this medicine if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have unstable or insulin dependent (type 1) diabetes</li>\n 	<li>Have metabolic acidosis (including diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis or history of either)</li>\n 	<li>Currently have or have had a liver or kidney problem</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had heart failure or cardiovascular problems (abrupt failure of blood circulation) or cardiorespiratory insufficiency</li>\n 	<li>Drink excessive amounts of alcohol</li>\n 	<li>Are highly stressed, have severe infections/inflammation, are experiencing trauma, are about to have surgery, or during a surgery recovery phase</li>\n 	<li>Have severe dehydration</li>\n 	<li>Are currently breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant</li>\n 	<li>Are about to receive an injection of dye or contrast agent for an imaging procedure</li>\n 	<li>Have any allergies to Saxagliptin, Metformin or any of the ingredients, or if you are allergic to other drugs belonging to the DPP-4 class</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\nKomboglyze contains Metformin, which in some cases can cause lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a serious condition that can cause death and must be treated in the hospital. Alcohol may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, so it is recommended to not drink a lot of alcohol while taking it.\n\nHeart Failure has also been reported in patients treated with Kombogylze. Heart failure is when your heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>upper respiratory tract infection</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>urinary tract infection (UTI)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>upset stomach (gas, abdominal bloating)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>loss of appetite</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) is more likely to occur in people who are taking a sulfonylurea drug or are on insulin treatment. If you have any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia, you should first check your blood sugar levels and treat them if they are low, then call your doctor. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include headache, shaking, rapid heartbeat, sweating, hunger, changes in vision, and change in mood.\n<h3>Serious negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, symptoms of which include swelling of the lips, face, or throat, difficulties breathing, hives, rash, itching, flaking or peeling skin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>lactic acidosis (an excess of lactic acid in your blood)</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTalk to your doctor about any side effects that do not go away. These are not all of the possible negative effects. Call your doctor if you have any questions about side effects.\n\n<strong>Manufacturer:</strong> ASTRAZENECA\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2><strong>Our Guarantee</strong></h2>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Komboglyze from Canada.

4075,variable,,Metformin,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Metformin (Glucophage)?</strong></h2>\nMetformin is a first-line medicine used for the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">treatment of type 2 diabetes</a>. It was discovered in the 1920s, and has since been marketed under various trade names, most recently as Glucophage. It is particularly effective in diabetics who are overweight.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Metformin</a> is an oral antidiabetic medication used to help you control your blood sugar levels. It is prescribed for people with type 2 diabetes, and is occasionally used together with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/what-does-insulin-do-to-your-body"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin</a> or other diabetes medications.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nMetformin is in the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-biguanides-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">biguanide class</a> of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">oral antidiabetic medications</a>. It works by helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally by:\n<ul>\n 	<li>decreasing the amount of sugar your liver produces</li>\n 	<li>decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb</li>\n</ul>\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are not able to produce enough insulin, or are unable to respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. When this happens, sugar builds up in the blood, which can lead to serious medical conditions including blindness, amputations, and kidney damage. Diabetes is also closely associated with heart problems. The primary goal of Metformin treatment is to help you lower your blood sugar to a normal level.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nWhile you take Metformin, or any other your <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetes-medications-list"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetic drugs</a>, continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your diabetes treatment by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you how much medicine to take and when to take it. Always follow the directions provided by your doctor for using this medicine. Taking this medicine with food will decrease the chance of developing symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Do not start or stop any medicine without consulting your doctor first.\n<h2><strong>Active Ingredients</strong></h2>\n<h3>Metformin hydrochloride (HCL)</h3>\nThe active ingredient in this medication is Metformin hydrochloride (HCl). HCl is the chemical salt of the drug which is commonly used in the production process of many drugs to make them stable, as well as water and acid soluble.\n<h2><strong>Metformin dosage</strong></h2>\nThe initial recommended dose is typically 500 mg, taken orally, twice a day, or 850 mg once a day. Only increase doses as your doctor recommends. Weekly increases in 500 mg increments or 850 mg every two weeks are generally well tolerated. A typical maintenance dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses. The maximum recommended dose is 2550 mg daily.\n<h3>Missed Doses</h3>\nIf you should happen to forget to take your tablet, take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for the missed dose. If you are not sure what to do after you miss a dose, contact your doctor for advice.\n<h3>Overdose</h3>\nIn general, an overdose may lead to increased symptoms as described under the “Side effects” and “Warnings and Precautions” section. If you think you have taken too many tablets, or suspect you have taken a larger dose than recommended immediately see your doctor, contact the poison control or go to the nearest hospital emergency department. Do this even if you experience no signs of discomfort or poisoning.\n<h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>\nMetformin is an extremely valuable drug and is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines, as one of the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health care system. It is generally well tolerated with a small risk of causing low blood sugar levels, and is relatively cost-effective. Besides being an approved medication for the treatment of diabetes, it has also been shown to be beneficial for weight loss in certain cases, to have some cardiovascular protection properties, as well as being able to help reduce the effects of metabolic syndrome.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Do not take these tablets if you:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>have metabolic acidosis (including diabetic ketoacidosis, history of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis)</li>\n 	<li>have a liver or kidney condition</li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/drink-alcohol-taking-metformin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">drink a lot of alcohol</a></li>\n 	<li>are going to have x-ray procedure with injection of dyes</li>\n 	<li>have high levels of stress, have severe infections, are experiencing some trauma prior to surgery or during the recovery phase</li>\n 	<li>suffer from severe dehydration</li>\n 	<li>are hypersensitive or allergic to metformin or any other ingredient in the formulation or component of the container</li>\n 	<li>are currently breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>are currently pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant</li>\n 	<li>suffer from cardiovascular collapse, which is an abrupt failure of blood circulation</li>\n 	<li>have or cardiorespiratory insufficiency, which is a difficulty with breathing caused by a weakened heart</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The drug may rarely cause a serious, life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis.</strong>\n<h4><strong>Signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis may include</strong>:</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Suddenly developing irregular or a slow heartbeat</li>\n 	<li>Feeling uncomfortable, very weak or tired</li>\n 	<li>Unexpected or unusual stomach discomfort</li>\n 	<li>Trouble breathing</li>\n 	<li>Feeling dizzy or lightheaded</li>\n 	<li>Feeling cold</li>\n 	<li>Unusual muscle pain</li>\n</ul>\nIf any of the above side effects occur, make sure to consult your doctor immediately. Remember to tell your doctor if you are currently pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant.\n\nMetformin should not be taken during pregnancy. Talk with your doctor about your treatment choices if you are pregnant. You must not take it if you are nursing a child, either. Insulin is generally the preferred <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/gestational-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">treatment for gestational diabetes</a>.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs when a woman without a previous history of diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes does not necessarily mean that you had diabetes before you conceived, or that you will have diabetes after pregnancy.\n\nTell your doctor if you have any other medical condition, including vitamin B12 deficiency, anemia, excessive alcohol use or allergies.\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Metformin side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>abdominal pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>upset stomach</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>abdominal</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>bloating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>gas</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>loss of appetite</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uncommon negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Suddenly developing irregular or a slow heartbeat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling uncomfortable, very weak or tired</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Unexpected or unusual stomach discomfort</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Trouble breathing</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling dizzy or lightheaded</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling cold</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Unusual muscle pain</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rare negative effects may include</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Lactic acidosis</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHigh levels of lactic acid in the blood can be a concern if the drug is prescribed inappropriately or you are taking overly large doses.\n\nTalk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

4079,simple,,"Nesina 12.5mg 30 Tablets",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Nesina (Alogliptin)?</strong></h2>\nNesina is a prescription medication that works as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">adipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor</a>.This medication is often prescribed along with exercise and a healthy diet to control blood sugar levels. Nesina is a product of Takeda Pharmaceuticals.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNesina is only indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drug is intended to be used in combination with other non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise and dietary modification. This medication is only intended for adult patients more than 18 years of age.Ensure to provide your doctor with your complete medical history prior to treatment. Nesina should not be used by patients with type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that causes increased ketones in the urine or blood.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nDo not use more (or less) than the prescribed amount. Do not change the dose of Nesina without consulting the doctor. If you are taking a lower dose of this medication and do not notice an improvement in your symptoms, tell your doctor. Do not stop taking this medication, even if you are feeling better. This medication can be taken with or without food and should be taken once daily.\n<h2><strong>How does this drug work?</strong></h2>\nNesina contains alogliptin as its active ingredient. DPP-4 inhibitors such as alogliptin can reverse the actions of insulin-reducing DDP-4 enzymes, helping to increase insulin release into the bloodstream. At the same time, alogliptin reduces postprandial and fasting glucose concentration in a glucose-dependent manner.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nNesina comes in three dose strengths: 6.25mg, 12.5mg and 25mg. All tablets are film-coated andoval-shaped.\n\nTo treat type II diabetes, it is recommended to take 25mg of Nesina once a day (with or without food).The drug can be used as amonotherapyor combination therapy. While taking Nesina, the dose of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/what-are-insulin-secretagogues-types-benefits-side-effects.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">insulin secretagogues</a> (e.g.sulfonylureas) or insulin should be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia.\n\nThe dose of Nesina needs to be adjusted based on renal function. While taking the drug, patients who have renal impairments should undergoexamination of renal function periodically.Inthe case of moderate renal impairment, use half of the recommended daily dose(12.5 mg). In patients with severe renal impairment, it is recommended to use 6.25 mg of Nesina once per day.During each trimester of pregnancy, the doctor may prescribe a different dose of Nesina. Similarly, the dose may need to be adjusted in breastfeeding patients.\n\nYour doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your condition and reaction to treatment. Follow your doctor’s instructions.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Stuffy nose</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sinus pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sore throat</strong></li>\n</ul>\nNesina on its own is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia, a condition where the blood sugar is dangerously low. Please note that this is not a complete list of all the possible side effects of Nesina. The drug may cause side effects other than the ones listed here.As a general rule, patients are advised to see a doctor if side effects persist or worsen.

4080,variable,,Onglyza,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Onglyza (Saxagliptin)?</strong></h2>\nOnglyza an oral antidiabetic medication that is prescribed alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise to help improve blood sugar levels in adults with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment.html"">type 2 diabetes mellitus</a>. Its chemical, or generic version is called Saxagliptin.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nOnglyza is used to help improve and regulate blood sugar levels in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is typically used in combination with the following antidiabetic drugs:\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Metformin</a></li>\n 	<li>Sulfonylurea</li>\n 	<li>Metformin and a sulfonylurea; or</li>\n 	<li><a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/different-types-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Insulin</a> (with or without metformin) when exercise and metformin, diet, sulfonylurea, insulin (with or without metformin), or metformin and a sulfonylurea alone have failed to sufficiently control blood sugar levels</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How does this medication work?</strong></h2>\nOnglyza belongs to a class of antidiabetic medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-dpp-4-inhibitors"">DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors)</a>. They help to improve blood sugar levels after a meal and lower blood sugar levels between meals, and they also help decrease the amount of sugar made by your body.\n\nLike all DPP-4 inhibitors, this medication slows down the breakdown of digestive hormones, which increases the overall amount of these hormones in the body. This increased amount of digestive hormones are responsible for the drug’s beneficial effects, which are increased insulin production in response to meals, decreased rate of sugar production in the liver, slower gastric emptying (the rate at which it takes the food to leave the stomach), a reduction in appetite, and improved regeneration of beta cells in the pancreas (the cells that store and produce insulin).\n<h2><strong>How to take Saxagliptin</strong></h2>\nSaxagliptin (Onglyza)is only prescribed for type 2 diabetes, and not prescribed for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetic ketoacidosis</a>. It is recommended to be taken once daily, with or without meals. The tablets must not be split or cut.\n\nBefore you take it, your doctor should administer a blood test that measures how well your kidneys are working before and during your treatment. You may need to change your dose if your kidneys are not working well.\n<h2><strong>Onglyza dosage</strong></h2>\nAlways follow the directions that were given to you by your doctor.\n\nThe usual recommended adult dose is 5 mg, taken once daily, with or without food. You might need a lower dose if your kidneys are not working well. When this medication is used together with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a smaller dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin might be required in order to minimize the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n<h2>Missed Doses</h2>\nIf you should miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not happen to remember until it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and just go back to your regular schedule. Never take a double dose.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<strong>Before you begin taking Onglyza talk to your doctor if:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You have had any allergic reaction to other DPP-4 inhibitors</li>\n 	<li>You have or have had any kidney complications</li>\n 	<li>You have or have had liver complications</li>\n 	<li>You have or have had heart failure</li>\n 	<li>You have been told you have a reduced immune system; for example, you have had organ transplantation or have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)</li>\n 	<li>You are currently pregnant or are planning to become pregnant</li>\n 	<li>You are currently breastfeeding or are planning to breastfeed</li>\n 	<li>You have or have had pancreatic problems such as pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)</li>\n 	<li>You start or stop taking other medications, including antibiotics, antifungals or HIV/AIDS medications</li>\n</ul>\nOnglyza should avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require dialysis.\n\nSince lactose monohydrate is one of the non-medicinal ingredients in Onglyza, do not take it if a doctor has told you that you have one of the following hereditary diseases: galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Upper respiratory tract infection</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Urinary tract infection (UTI)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Urinary tract infection</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heart failure</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Joint Pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Bullous pemphigoid (a skin reaction)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Peripheral edema (fluid retention)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>High blood sugar level (hyperglycemia)</strong></li>\n</ul>\nPancreatitis is a serious condition and can lead to death. Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of what might be pancreatitis. These symptoms may include severe and persistent stomach pain. The pain may feel like it is going from the front of your abdomen through to your back. This may occur with or without vomiting.\n\nContact your doctor immediately if you think you may have any of the following symptoms of heart failure: shortness of breath or trouble breathing, particularly when you are lying down, swelling of the feet, ankles or legs, a rapid increase in weight. You are at a greater risk of heart failure if you currently have or have had:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Kidney disease</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Several risk factors of getting heart disease</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heart or blood vessel disease including heart failure or heart attack</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWhen used with certain types of other antidiabetic medicines, such as a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"">sulfonylureas</a> or insulin, the chance of getting low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is higher.\n<h3>Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Shaking</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Rapid heartbeat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Changes in mood</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Changes in vision</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSome people who take DPP-4 inhibitors can break out in a skin condition called bullous pemphigoid that may be serious and may require hospital treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a breakdown of the outer layer of your skin, which would include blisters and hives.\n\nWhen used alongside a thiazolidinedione (TZD), like <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-pioglitazone-15-30-45-mg/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">pioglitazone </a>or rosiglitazone, fluid retention may become more severe. If you happen to get any symptoms of what you think may be peripheral edema, such as swelling of your feet, ankles or hands, make sure to call your doctor.\n\nYour blood sugar level may also get too high (hyperglycemia) if you have fever, infection, surgery, or trauma (stressful conditions). In these cases, contact your doctor immediately as your medication may need to be changed.\n\nTalk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible negative effects. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Our Guarantee</h2>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Onglyza (Saxagliptin) from Canada.

4084,variable,,Pioglitazone,1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Pioglitazone (Actos)?</strong></h2>\nPioglitazone is a generic prescription drug used to treat type 2 diabetes that helps make your body more sensitive to the insulin that is in your system. It is marketed under the brand name Actos and it is part of the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">thiazolidinedione (TZD) class</a>.\n<h2><strong>What is </strong><strong>Actos </strong><strong>used for?</strong></h2>\nPioglitazone is used to <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment.html"">treat type 2 diabetes</a>, in addition to a healthy diet and regular exercise, in order to help you improve your blood sugar control.\n<h2><strong>How does this drug work?</strong></h2>\nPioglitazone is a member of a family of drugs called thiazolidinediones, or TZDs for short, that are called insulin-sensitizing compounds, which means they help your body react better to its own <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/what-does-insulin-do-to-your-body"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin</a>. This reduces the overall blood sugar level in the body. It regulates the genes that are involved in the control of sugar and fat breakdown in the body. As a result, it reduces insulin resistance (a condition in which the cells in your body fail to respond normally to insulin), decreases gluconeogenesis (the production of sugar from food) in the liver, and reduces blood sugar levels.\n\nSince Actos does not actually make your body create more insulin, it very infrequently causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is a common side effect of many <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">oral antidiabetic medications</a> when used individually.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nAlways make sure to follow all the directions on your prescription label. Sometimes your doctor may modify your dose, or schedule in order to make sure you get the best results. Always follow your doctor’s instructions above all others.\n\nPioglitazone is usually taken once daily, with or without food. Never change your dose or schedule without your doctor’s approval.\n\nYour blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may need other blood tests at your doctor’s office in order to <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">prevent low blood sugar</a>.\n<h3>Symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) include</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>pale skin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>feeling shaky</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>irritability</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble concentrating</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAlways keep a source of sugar with you in case you experience low blood sugar. Your doctor can also prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit and show you how to use it.\n\nAlways monitor your blood sugar levels carefully, especially during times of stress, illness, travel, surgery or other medical procedures, prolonged exercise, or if you drink alcohol or miss meals. All of these things can affect your blood sugar levels which means your dose needs may also change.\n\nPioglitazone is only part of a treatment program that may also include a healthy diet, regular exercise, supervised weight control, continual blood sugar testing, and in some cases, special medical care.\n<h2><strong>Pioglitazone dosage</strong></h2>\nPioglitazone should be taken once daily with or without meals. Its initial dose is usually between 15 or 30 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose is 45 mg once daily.\n\nIt can only help you control your blood sugar levels if you take it regularly. Generally, it should be taken at the same time everyday at whatever time you find most fitting and convenient for you to remember.\n\nFor patients without congestive heart failure, the usual initial dose is 15 mg or 30 mg orally once a day. For patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class I or II), the usual initial dose is 15 mg orally once a day. A typical maintenance dose is between 15 mg to 45 mg orally once a day based on your blood sugar level response.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<strong>Pioglitazone should not be used by patients who:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Are allergic to pioglitazone or any other ingredients</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had heart problems or heart failure</li>\n 	<li>Have serious liver damage</li>\n 	<li>Have or have had bladder cancer</li>\n 	<li>Have blood or a red colour in their urine</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant, or are planning on becoming pregnant</li>\n</ul>\nIt is not approved for use with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">metformin</a>, a sulfonylurea or with insulin therapy.\n\nIf you do happen to take Actos with a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sulfonylurea</a>, you may develop low blood sugar.

It belongs to a class of medications known as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/meglitinides-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">meglitinides</a>, or simply Glinides for short. If needed, other diabetes medicines can be sometimes prescribed together with it. It should be used in addition to a healthy diet and regular exercise.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nRepaglinide is used to help lower blood sugar levels in patients with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">type 2 diabetes</a> whose blood sugar levels cannot be regulated by diet and exercise alone. It can also be used in combination with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/metformin-details.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">metformin </a>or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/avandia-diabetes-medication-work"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rosiglitazone </a>to help lower blood sugar levels in patients whose blood sugar levels cannot be regulated by diet and exercise only, or with metformin or rosiglitazone alone.\n<h2><strong>How does </strong><strong>Prandin </strong><strong>work?</strong></h2>\nRepaglinide is an oral <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic drug</a> that helps your body release more <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/what-does-insulin-do-to-your-body"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin</a> when your blood sugar levels get too high. It is part of a class of drugs called meglitinides, as mentioned above. It works by lowering blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas. Insulin itself regulates the breakdown of food (carbohydrates, fats and protein) by promoting the absorption of sugar from the blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nYour doctor will prescribe Repaglinide depending on your individual needs. You should always take it exactly as prescribed by your doctor. The dose can be taken with food, usually 15 minutes before a meal. However, it may be taken 30 minutes before a meal or even right before a meal.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nAlways follow the directions on the prescription label. To get the best results, your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Never take it in bigger or smaller amounts or for longer or shorter period than recommended by your doctor.\n\nRepaglinide is usually taken two to four times a day, within 30 minutes before a meal. If you should happen to skip a meal, do not take that missed dose and just wait until your next meal.\n\nThe recommended dose range is in between 0.5 to 4 mg orally with each meal, with the maximum recommended daily dose being 16 mg.\n<h3>Individualized Therapy</h3>\nFor patients who have not been previously treated with any other diabetes medication, or whose average longer-term blood sugar level, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), is less than 8%, the initial dose is usually 0.5 mg orally with each meal. For patients who have been previously treated with antidiabetic agents or whose HbA1c is 8% or higher, the initial dose is usually 1 to 2 mg orally with each meal.\n\nDose adjustments are commonly made in response to your own blood sugar response. Your doctor may double your dose up to a maximum meal time dose of 4 mg until a satisfactory blood sugar level response is achieved. You should allow at least one week to assess your blood sugar level response after each dose adjustment.\n\nYour blood sugar levels will need to be checked often, and your doctor may require you to take other blood tests. Your blood sugar level should be carefully monitored during times of stress, illness, travel, surgery or a medical emergency, strenuous exercise, or if you happen to drink alcohol or skip meals. All of these things may affect your blood sugar levels and your dose needs may also change because of them.

It also helps you decrease the amount of sugar that is made by your body itself.\n\nDPP-4 inhibitors prevent certain hormones involved with eating and insulin regulation from being broken down. This allows for more insulin to be released from pancreatic beta cells while staggering glucagon release, which prevents blood sugar level increases. In general, along with a healthy diet and regular exercise, it can help your <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/organ-human-body-produces-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">body produce more insulin</a> and lower blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nRemember to always let your doctor or pharmacist know about all the medicines you take.

4095,simple,,"Apidra Solostar Pens 100 Units / mL",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What are Apidra SoloSTAR Pens?</strong></h2>\nApidra SoloSTAR Pens are disposable <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-pens-types-benefits-uses-storage.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin pens</a> pre-filled with Apidra. Apidra is the brand name of insulin glulisine, which is a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rapid-acting insulin</a> analog that is used during mealtime for the treatment of high blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes. It is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) within 15 minutes before or 20 minutes after starting a meal. This medication comed in 3 mL pens and in a package of five.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nApidra SoloSTAR Pens are used for the subcutaneous injection of insulin glulisine for the control of your blood sugar during and after meals. It is a man-made rapid-acting insulin, otherwise known as a mealtime or bolus insulin. Along with regular exercise, a healthy meal plan, and an intermediate- or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/long-acting-insulin-names-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">long-acting insulin</a>, this medicine is shown to be helpful in reducing blood sugar levels in adults and children (6 years and older) with type 1 diabetes or adults with type 2 diabetes.\n<h2><strong>How does this insulin glulisine work?</strong></h2>\nApidra, or insulin glulisine which is its generic name, is very similar in structure to naturally occurring human insulin and therefore it has a very similar mechanism of action in the when injected. In healthy people insulin is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. Its main job in the body is to control blood sugar levels by promoting the absorption of sugar from the blood into the cells of the liver, fat and skeletal muscle. It also blocks the production of sugar in the liver and reduces the release of sugar back into the blood stream. This allows sugar to remain in the cells of you body to be used as energy to carry out all the basic functions of life.\n\nInsulin glulisine is a type of man-made insulin called a mealtime, or bolus insulin which is developed to help protect you against the blood sugar spiked seen after and during meals. It has a rapid onset of about 15 minutes and a duration of action of about four hours. This allows greater flexibility for your mealtimes, so you don’t have to wait a long time for your insulin to start working before eating.\n\nThe pen is comes pre-filled and is disposable after it is finished. Each pen contains multiple doses of insulin glulisine and you can set your doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of one unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Once opened, your pen can be used for up to 28 days unrefrigerated.\n<h2><strong>Apidra side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Less common negative effects may include:</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Weight gain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Edema</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hypoglycemia</a> (low blood sugar) is the most common side effect of insulin therapy and also with Apidra. You should educate yourself on how to recognize and manage low blood sugar events. Severe drops in your blood sugar level may cause to unconsciousness, seizures and lead to temporary or permanent problems with brain function and even death.\n\nLong-term use of Apidra can lead to a condition called lipodystrophy. The repeated injection of insulin into a particular site on the body can lead to either lipohypertrophy which is the thickening of fat tissue around the injection site, or lipoatrophy, which is the thinning of fat tissue around the injection site. Always remember to rotate your insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of these skin site issues.\n\nAll <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-insulin-injection-medications-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin products</a>, including this, cause a change in potassium (K+) levels which can possibly leading to hypokalemia. If untreated hypokalemia can cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.\n\nWeight gain can also occur with insulin therapy. This can occur because insulin plays a role in anabolism, which is the body creating larger more complex molecules from smaller ones. Insulin can also decrease the elimination of sugar through the urine which can contribute to weight gain as well.\n\nEdema is the swelling caused by fluid and sodium retention and may occur with your insulin therapy. It can occur in any part of your body however it is most noticeable in the legs and arms, including the ankle, hands, and feet.\n\nA severe, generalized allergy, which includes anaphylaxis can occur with any insulin, including Apidra. You may be experiencing a serious allergic reaction, otherwise known as a whole body reaction if you begin to develop a rash over your entire body, your heart starts beating very fast, have trouble breathing or begin sweating. Get help immediately if you have any of these side-effects.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nFor a mealtime insulin like Apidra you may need to do multiple daily injections, so knowing how to properly take it is very important. Remember to always follow your doctor’s advice and consult with them before you make any changes to your insulin dose and schedule.\n<h3>Important information</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Do not share injection pens, cartridges, needles or syringes with anyone even if the needle on the injection pen is changed</li>\n 	<li>Always attach a new needle before each use</li>\n 	<li>Do not select a dose and press the injection button without a needle attached</li>\n 	<li>Always perform the safety test before each injection</li>\n 	<li>If your injection is given to you by another person, they must take special caution to avoid any accidental needle injury and transmission of infection</li>\n 	<li>Never use your SoloSTAR pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure if it is working properly</li>\n 	<li>Always have a spare SoloSTAR pen just in case yours is damaged or lost</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe dosage of this medication must be individualized and blood sugar level monitoring is essential for anyone receiving any type of insulin therapy.\n\nApidra is given by subcutaneous injection into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Injection sites should be changed within the same region from one injection to the next to help decrease the risk of lipodystrophy.\n\nAprida is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin which means it should be given within 15 minutes before the start of a meal or within 20 minutes after you started the meal. It is typically be used in regimens along with an <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/intermediate-acting-insulin-types-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intermediate-acting</a> or long-acting insulin to provide you with insulin coverage for the entire day.\n\nYour total daily insulin requirement may vary but is usually between 0.5 to 1 Unit/kg daily. Your insulin requirements may have to be changed during stress, major illness, or with changes in exercise, meal patterns, or with any co-administered drugs.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not take it:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>If you are allergic to any of the ingredients in Apidra</li>\n 	<li>When your blood sugar is too low</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have kidney or liver problems</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding</li>\n 	<li>Have heart failure or other heart problems</li>\n 	<li>Are taking drugs called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TZDs</a> (thiazolidinediones)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Apidra Solostar pens from Canada.

4097,simple,,"Basaglar KwikPen",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 5 Insulin KwikPens x 3.0 mL each</h3>","<h2><strong>What is Basaglar?</strong></h2>\nBasaglar belongs to a type of diabetes medication called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/long-acting-insulin-names-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">long-acting insulin</a>, which works a few hours after injection and lasts for a day. Basaglar is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, a Burlington-based pharmaceutical corporation.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nBasaglar is mainly used in adult patients for the management of type I and type II diabetes mellitus. In pediatric patients, it is only indicated for the treatment of type I diabetes. Basaglar effectively regulates the metabolism of glucose, thereby improving glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Please note that Basaglar is not effective in treating diabetic ketoacidosis.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nUse Basaglar exactly as directed. Before using Basaglar, patients should always read the labels. Patients should be trained to inject Basaglar using appropriate techniques.\n\nBasaglar is designed to be injected into the deltoid, thigh, or abdominal area. In order to minimize the risk of lipodystrophy, patients should rotate the sites of injection. Patient are advised against mixing or diluting Basaglar, as this may alter the time to peak effect or onset of action in an unpredictable way. Basaglar should not be administered via an insulin pump or intravenously, as this can lead to severe hypoglycemia.\n\nAs with many other diabetes medications, Basaglar is often prescribed as part of a treatment program that often involves weight control, exercise, diet, eye care, foot care, and dental care. While on Basaglar, doctors may need to perform blood glucose tests on a regular basis. For optimal treatment results, patients should follow their exercise routines and diet/medication regimen closely.\n<h2><strong>How does this drug work?</strong></h2>\nBasically, Basaglar (insulin glargine) works by regulating the metabolism of glucose. Through the stimulation of glucose uptake by fat and skeletal muscle, insulin and <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-analogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">insulin analogues</a> are able to lower blood sugar levels. At the same time, Basaglar has an inhibitory action on the hepatic production of glucose. It is believed that insulin can enhance protein synthesis and inhibit proteolysis and lipolysis.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe sterile, colorless injectable solution is supplied in a prefilled 3ml delivery device.\n\nThe dose of Basaglar varies from patient to patient, ranging from 1 to 80 units. This medication should be injected once per day at the same time every day. For the treatment of type I diabetes, it is recommended to initiate the treatment with 1/3 of the total daily requirements for insulin. In addition to Basaglar, pre-meal insulin and rapid- or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/short-acting-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">short-acting insulin</a> should be used to fulfill the rest of the daily insulin requirement. If indicated for treating type I diabetes, Basaglar must be used in combination with a short- or <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rapid-acting insulin</a>.\n\nAs for type II diabetes, patients should use 0.2 units/kg (or up to 10 units once a day) initially. While taking Basaglar, the dose and timing of other diabetes medicines (including rapid- or short-acting insulins) may need to be adjusted.\n\nThe dose of Basaglar should be adjusted to reflect changes in hepatic or renal function, physical activities and meal patterns (e.g. timing of food intake or macronutrient content).\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>hollowing/thickening of the skin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>mild skin rash</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>itching</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of all the potential side effects of Basaglar.

4234,variable,,"Humalog Kwikpen",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Humalog KwikPen?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog KwikPen is a type of insulin delivery device (insulin pen) for the use of Humalog Insulin Lispro. The KwikPen is a pre-filled, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-pens-types-benefits-uses-storage.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">disposable insulin pen</a> designed to make it easier for you to administer your doses of insulin. The pen is a convenient method that allows you to subcutaneously (under the skin) inject your dose without having to use a vial, needle and syringe. The package comes with 5 disposable insulin pens which contains 3 mL of Insulin Lispro.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog KwikPen contains Humalog Insulin Lispro, which is a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rapid-acting</a> human insulin analog used to help control blood sugar levels in children and adults with diabetes mellitus. The KwikPen is used to help conveniently administer your Insulin Lispro dose without the uncertainty involved with proper injection technique, and the additional involvement of vials, needles, syringes, etc.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog KwikPen is pre-filled with Humalog Insulin Lispro, which is a man-made insulin analog that works similar to naturally occurring insulin. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by beta cells in the pancreas, which is a large organ near your stomach. Insulin is primarily involved with the regulation of blood sugar levels by controlling the break down of food (sugars, fats and proteins) and promoting the absorption of sugar from your blood into your fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells.\n\nThe KwikPen has a compact size and simple design that allows you to manage your blood sugar levels at home or on the go with accurate, straightforward and convenient Insulin Lispro delivery.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic Acidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most frequently reported side effect of Insulin Lispro is low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia.\n<h3>Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>fast heartbeat,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>excessive hunger,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>weakness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>blurred vision,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>tremor,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>drowsiness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble concentrating,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>seizure (convulsions).</strong></li>\n</ul>\nSkin site irritation (local allergy) in is also common. Swelling, redness and itching can happen at your injection site. In some cases, it may be related to things such as contaminants in the skin cleansing agent or due to your injection technique, and not the Insulin Lispro itself.\n\nDiabetic acidosis can develop if your body has too little insulin. This may be brought on if you forget your insulin or take less than you doctor has prescribed, eat too much, or develop a fever or infection. The first symptoms typically come on gradually, over a period of hours or days, and include a drowsy feeling, thirst, flushed face, and loss of appetite. Heavy breathing and a quick pulse are more severe symptoms. If left without intervention it can result in the loss of consciousness, coma, or even death. If you experience any of these symptoms it is very important that you get medical assistance immediately\n\nRarely the subcutaneous injection of insulin can result in lipoatrophy, which is a depression in your skin or lipohypertrophy, the enlargement or thickening of tissue. If you notice any changes in, and around your injection site, or any of these conditions, contact your doctor immediately. Changing your injection technique might help get rid of any of these issues.\n\nOther less commonly reported side effects can include hypokalemia, which is the presence of low levels of potassium (K+) in the blood, and more severe side effects can include anaphylaxis, which is a serious allergic reaction, and other hypersensitivity, or allergic reactions.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nHumalog Insulin Lispro has a quick onset of activity that requires that you take it within 15 minutes before the start of a meal, or within 20 minutes after the start of the meal.\n\nThe Humalog KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen that contains 3 mL of Insulin Lispro. The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time and you can give yourself multiple doses with one pen. You can give yourself 1 to 60 units in one injection. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your doctor. Refer to your KwikPen “instructions for use” for proper instructions and always carefully follow your doctor’s directions.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour dose of Humalog Insulin Lispro was determined by your doctor in order to give you the blood sugar level control you specifically need. Your dose and dose schedule should be adjusted in order to maintain your blood sugar at the healthiest level possible.\n\nYou should subcutaneously (under the skin) inject your dose within 15 minutes before the start of your meal or immediately after the meal (within 20 minutes of starting your meal). Suitable injection sites are; the tissue of the upper arm, abdomen, buttocks or thigh.\n\nYour usual dose and schedule might be affected by changes in your food intake, level of activity, or work schedule. Always carefully follow your doctor’s instructions to allow for these types of changes. Other things that may affect your dose and dose schedule are illness, taking other medications, pregnancy, exercise and travel.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nDo not share your Humalog KwikPen with anyone else, even if the needle has been changed. Do not transfer the insulin from your KwikPen to a syringe. Syringes will not measure the units/mL of insulin correctly. A severe overdose may result, causing very low blood sugar levels which may put your life at risk. The KwikPen is not recommended for use if you are blind or visually impaired without the help of someone trained to use the Pen.\n\n<strong>Before you use your KwikPen talk to your doctor or pharmacist if</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>You have or have had trouble with your kidneys or liver</li>\n 	<li>You begin to exercise more than usual</li>\n 	<li>You want to change your usual diet</li>\n 	<li>You drink alcohol</li>\n 	<li>You are traveling across more than 2 time zones</li>\n 	<li>You are sick</li>\n 	<li>You are pregnant, or are planning on becoming pregnant</li>\n 	<li>You use other medicines, or supplements</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Our Guarantee</strong></h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for the Humalog KwikPen from Canada.

4237,variable,,"Humalog Mix Cartridges",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What are Humalog Mix Cartridges?</strong></h2>\nHumalog Mix Cartridges contain insulin lispro, which is a genetically engineered insulin analog.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nHumalog Mix Cartridges are used in <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-pens-types-benefits-uses-storage.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin pens</a> for the treatment of patients living with diabetes mellitus who need insulin to maintain blood sugar level control. They are also indicated for the initial stabilization of diabetes mellitus. They are used to control your diabetes by keeping your blood sugar at a healthy level.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog Mix Cartridges contain a mixture of two types of man-made insulin: <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fast-acting insulin</a> lispro and the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/long-acting-insulin-names-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">long-acting</a> insulin lispro protamine.\n\ninsulin lispro belongs to a group of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-analogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin analogs</a> called mealtime, or bolus insulin. They have a quick onset of action and begin to work in minutes. This provides you with the coverage you need for the spikes of blood sugar that occur during and after a meal. It begins to work about 15 minutes after the injection, achieving peak blood levels in 30 to 70 minutes and lasts for approximately 2 to 5 hours. It should be taken about 15 minutes prior your meal and, if need be, can be taken within 20 minutes of the beginning of the meal.\n\nInsulin lispro protamine is a long-acting insulin that belongs to the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/intermediate-acting-insulin-types-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intermediate-acting insulin</a> analog group. Small proteins, called protamines, are added to the insulin lispro formulation to slow down the onset and prolong the duration of the insulin action. The activity profile of insulin lispro protamine is similar to that of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH</a>, or isophane insulin, which is a commonly prescribed insulin that has an onset of about 90 minutes and a duration of approximately 24 hours.\n\nTogether, the combination of both types of insulin provides you with a full day’s coverage of your blood sugar control needs, including before, during and after your meals.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site irritation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy (lipoatrophy)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most common side effect of Humalog is hypoglycemia, otherwise known as low blood sugar.\n<h4>Symptoms of low blood sugar include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>fast heartbea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>weakness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>blurred vision</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>drowsiness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>tremor</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble concentrating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>seizure (convulsions).</strong></li>\n</ul>\nInjection site irritation, such as redness, itching and swelling in patients is also common. This usually settles in a few days to a few weeks. This may not be due to the Humalog 50/50 mixture and may be related to other things such as contaminants in a skin cleansing product or an improper injection technique.\n\nLess common side effects may include hypokalemia, which occurs when there is an appearance of dangerously low levels of potassium (K+) in the blood, and lipodystrophy, which is a disorder of fat production, specifically lipoatrophy, the localized loss of fat tissue. Serious side effects may also include anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) and other hypersensitivity or allergic reactions.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nPrior to first use, Humalog Cartridges should be stored in a refrigerator between 2° and 8°C, be careful not to freeze the insulin. Be sure to read the patient information leaflet provided by your doctor before you begin using Humalog and each time you get a refill. The suspension mixture should be white. It should be administered subcutaneously (under the skin). You must be careful not to hit any major blood vessels when injecting your insulin.\n\nHumalog 50/50 and 25/75 should be given between 15 minutes before a meal, or up to 20 minutes after you have begun eating.\n\nDespite these suggestions, always follow your doctor’s instructions above all others when taking this medication.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nAlways carefully follow your doctor’s directions about your dosage, as well. Specifically, on which insulin to use, how much, and when and how often to inject it. Each case of diabetes is unique and your doctor will likely personalize your dosing schedule for you, specifically. Your dose and schedule may be affected by changes in the food you eat, your activity level, or your schedule at work. Other factors that may effect your dose are pregnancy, illness, other medications, exercise and travel.\n\nYou should administer your dose within 15 minutes of the start of your meal or within 20 minutes of eating your meal. The most common injection sites include the abdomen, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks. To help reduce the risk of lipodystrophy, which is a disorder in fat production, rotate your injection site within the same region between doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>When this medication should not be used:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>When your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia). After treating your low blood sugar, follow your doctor’s instructions on the use of Humalog.</li>\n 	<li>If you are allergic to anything in Humalog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Before using it, tell your doctor if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You have or had problems with your kidneys or liver.</li>\n 	<li>You drink alcohol (including wine and beer).</li>\n 	<li>You are sick.</li>\n 	<li>You exercise more than usual, or if you want to change your usual exercise or diet routine.</li>\n 	<li>You are pregnant, or you are planning on becoming pregnant.</li>\n 	<li>You are traveling across more than two time zones.</li>\n 	<li>Take other prescription medicine(s).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Humalog mix 50/50 and 25/75  from Canada.

4240,variable,,"Humalog Mix KwikPens",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 5 pens x 3 mL each</h3>","<h2><strong>What is Humalog Mix KwikPen?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog Mix KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled insulin pen. It has a compact size and simple design that allows you to manage your blood sugar levels at home or on the go with convenient, easy and accurate insulin delivery.\n\nHumalog contains insulin lispro, a genetically engineered, fast-acting insulin with quicker absorption and faster onset of action than naturally occurring human insulin. Humalog also contains insulin protamine, which is an intermediate-acting insulin that has small proteins called protamines added to lengthen its duration of activity and decrease its onset of action. When combined together, the two types of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-analogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin analogs</a> in Humalog Mix give you blood sugar control for the entire day, including before, during and after meals.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nThe Humalog Mix KwikPen has a mixture of insulin lispro and insulin protamine, which are both insulin analogs used to control of blood sugar levels in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. It also provides a convenient option for subcutaneous injection of a 50/50 and 25/75mixture of Humalog insulin. The KwikPen technology allows for easy injection of your insulin without any of the uncertainty that can be involved with self-administering injections with a syringe, and without the involvement of additional equipment, such as needles and vials.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nInsulin analogs are synthetic insulins manufactured to work like naturally occurring human insulin. Naturally occurring insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells in the pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels by regulating the breakdown of food and promotes the absorption of sugar from the blood into your fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells.\n\nInsulin lispro, an active ingredient in this medication, is a bolus (mealtime) insulin, which is used to prevent the fluctuations in blood sugar levels during and after meals. It has a rapid onset and a short duration of action, which makes it a leading option for the short-term regulation of blood sugar levels. Insulin lispro protamine is categorized as an intermediate-acting insulin analog, which has a longer onset and duration of action that makes it suitable for a long-term protection against blood sugar level fluctuations. Lispro protamine has a similar activity and absorption profile as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH insulin (isophane insulin)</a>, another common intermediate-acting insulin analog.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (Hypoglycemia)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most common side effect of the Mix KwikPen is low blood sugar, which is called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hypoglycemia</a>.\n<h4>Symptoms of having too low blood sugar may include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>drowsiness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>excessive hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>fast heartbeat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>tremor</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble concentrating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>blurred vision</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>weakness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>seizure (convulsions).</strong></li>\n</ul>\nOther common side effects are skin site irritations, or local allergies, such as swelling, redness and itching at the injection site. These effects may be related to impurities in the cleansing agent, or due to a poor injection technique, and not specifically to the Mix 50 KwikPen.\n\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Diabetic ketoacidosis,</a> which is a serious condition where your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones, can develop if you do not have enough insulin in your body. This can occur if you forget your insulin dose, take less than your usual dose, eat too much food, or become sick with an infection or fever. The symptoms tend to come on slowly, over a period of hours or days, and include an excessive thirst, feeling drowsy, flushed face and the loss of appetite. A rapid increase in pulse and heavy breathing may be signs of even more severe symptoms. This is a potentially lethal condition, and if left without intervention it can result in the loss of consciousness, coma, or even death. If you experience these symptoms it is very important that you contact your doctor and get medical help immediately.\n\nLess common side effects can also include hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood) and lipoatrophy (localized loss of fat tissue around your injection site). Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) and other allergies or hypersensitivity reactions.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nHumalog Mix KwikPens should be administered subcutaneously about 15 minutes before a meal, or within 20 minutes after the start of the meal.\n\nThe Humalog KwikPen is a pre-filled, disposable insulin pen, which dials one unit at a time and contains many doses in only one pen. It is possible to give yourself up to 60 units in one injection. Before use, refer to your KwikPen “instructions for use” for specific administration instructions and always remember to carefully follow your doctor’s directions.\n\nHumalog Mix KwikPens can be injected under the skin in your stomach area, back of upper arms, upper legs, or buttocks. Never inject into a vein or into muscle tissue. Always use a different site each time when you inject, and do not use any single injection site too often. Talk to your doctor about the best injection sites for you.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour individual dose schedule will vary compared to others with diabetes. Your doctor, who is familiar with your specific eating habits, personal metabolic needs, and other lifestyle factors will prescribe a dosage that is right for you.\n\nHumalog Mix KwikPens are approximately equal to naturally occurring insulin, with one unit having the same effect on lowering blood sugar as one unit of naturally occurring human insulin, although Mix insulin is more rapid and has a shorter duration. If you are switching the type of insulin you are using, it should be done carefully and under your doctor’s supervision. Switching insulin types, strength, species, manufacturer, or method of manufacture can also cause you to change your dose or dose schedule.\n\nAs with all insulin analogs, the absorption and duration of Humalog Mix action can vary in different people and even within the same person depending on changes in diet, exercise, and overall health. The rate of insulin absorption and its onset of activity can be affected by the injection site you use, exercise, and other factors. Remember to carefully follow your doctor’s directions to allow for these kinds of changes. Other variables that can affect your dose are illness, other medications you may be taking, travel and pregnancy.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nHumalog Mix KwikPen should never be shared between patients, even if you change the needle.\n\n<strong>Before using your KwikPen, talk to your doctor if</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant</li>\n 	<li>You have or have had trouble with your kidneys or liver</li>\n 	<li>You want to change your usual diet</li>\n 	<li>You drink alcohol</li>\n 	<li>You use other medicines, or supplements</li>\n 	<li>You begin to exercise more than usual</li>\n 	<li>You are traveling across more than two time zones</li>\n 	<li>You feel you may be sick</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Humalog Kwik Pen from Canada.

4243,simple,,"Humalog Cartridge 100 Units / mL",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What are Humalog Cartridges?</strong></h2>\nHumalog cartridges are filled with Insulin Lispro which is a fast acting man-made insulin. Insulin analogs are man-made used for the treatment of diabetes. Insulin Lispro is a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fast acting insulin</a> which is sometimes called a mealtime, or bolus insulin. This is because it is designed for use just prior to eating a meal to help prevent the fluctuations in your blood sugar levels that occur during and after a meal. Compared to naturally occurring human insulin, Insulin Lispro has a shorter onset of action so you have a shorter waiting period after injection before starting your meal.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-humalog-products-online/"">Humalog</a> (Insulin Lispro) is a man-made fast-acting insulin analog created using genetic engineering. It is very similar in structure to naturally occurring human insulin. The minor modifications in structure give Insulin Lispro a rapid absorption and shorter delay of onset compared to naturally occurring insulin. It starts to work about 15 minutes after subcutaneous (under the skin) injection, achieving peak blood levels 30-70 minutes after, and lasts about two to five hours. It should be taken 15 minutes before your meal and, if necessary may be taken right after a meal within 20 minutes of the beginning of the meal).\n\nInsulin Lispro’s mode of action is very similar to that of naturally occurring insulin. It is a hormone that controls your blood sugar levels by regulating the breakdown of food (sugars, fats and proteins) and promotes the absorption of sugar from the blood into your fat, liver and musculoskeletal cells.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nHumalog cartridges are filled with Insulin Lispro used along with the Humalog KwikPen, which is used in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in adults and children. There is some evidence that it is also effective in preventing diabetic neuropathy, cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy although it has not been approved officially for of any of these issues. Insulin Lispro is indicated for the initial stabilization of blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and also for the long-term maintenance of blood sugar levels. Since it is fast-acting (begins to work in 15 minutes) and with a short duration (up to 5 hours) it should be supplemented with a long-acting insulin, like Humulin N for full-day blood sugar level protection.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nAlways follow your doctor’s directions about your dose amount and dosing schedule. Every case of diabetes is unique that’s why your schedule has been individualized specifically for you and your insulin needs. Your normal dose may be effected by changes the food you eat, your activity level, or work schedule. Other factors that may effect your dosing are pregnancy, other medications, illness, travel and exercise. Always follow your doctor’s directions carefully.\n\nYou should administer your dose within 15 minutes of the start of your meal or right after your meal (within 20 minutes). The subcutaneous (under the skin) injection sites are; the tissue of the abdomen, buttocks, thigh or upper arm. To reduce the risk of lipodystrophy remember to change or rotate your injection site between doses. In order to get a full day’s worth of blood sugar level protection coverage it is recommended that you supplement your Humalog Insulin Lispro with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin such as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-humulin-n-nph-insulin-u-100-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Humulin N (insulin isophane [NPH])</a>.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nHumalog Insulin Lispro has a fast onset so it is recommended to be taken 15 minutes before the beginning of your meal, and if needed up to 20 minutes after the start of your meal.\n\nDo not use the product if it looks cloudy, thickened, or colored even slightly, or if there are any solid particles visible. Only use it if it is a clear, and colorless solution.\n\nIf you are mixing it with a longer acting insulin, the shorter acting insulin has to be drawn into the syringe first then followed by the longer acting insulin. Mixing both of the insulin before the injection should be only on advice of your doctor.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most common side effect of all insulin products, including Insulin Lispro, is low blood sugar, known as hypoglycemia.\n<h4>Symptoms of low blood sugar may include:</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>nausea,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>drowsiness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>fast heartbeat,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>weakness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>hunger,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>tremor,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>blurred vision,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion,</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble concentrating or seizures (convulsion).</strong></li>\n</ul>\nInjection site reactions are also commonly reported side-effects. Itching, swelling and redness can occur at the injection site, but they usually go away in several days or weeks. It may also be related to such things as impurities in your cleansing products or because of an improper injection technique, rather than the Insulin Lispro itself.\n\nHypokalemia which is the drop of potassium (K+) levels in the blood has also been reported with some patients. Symptoms of which may include weakness, feeling tired, constipation and leg cramps.\n\nAnother reported side-effect is lipodystrophy which can be either lipoatrophy, which is the localized loss of fat tissue around the injection site, or lipohypertrophy, which is the accumulation of fat around the injection site. A more serious side effect may be anaphylaxis, which is a generalized allergic reaction.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nDo not use Humalog Insulin Lispro if your blood sugar level is too low (hypoglycemia). Once you have treated your low blood sugar, you should follow your doctor’s directions on how to use your Humulog Insulin Lispro. Your blood sugar can be affected by stress, medical procedures (like surgery), illness, exercise, drinking alcohol, or skipping meals. Never change your insulin dose or schedule without consulting your doctor beforehand.\n\nDo not use Humalog Insulin Lispro if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the Humalog cartridge.\n\nYou should never share your syringe, cartridge or injection pen with anyone even if the needle has been changed.\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Humalog Cartridges from Canada.

Rapid-acting insulin analogs are also referred to as bolus, or mealtime insulin. It is genetically engineered from a safe laboratory strain of <em>E. coli. bacteria</em> specifically to help control the spike in blood sugar level during and after eating.\n\nHumalog vials contain insulin lispro for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. It is available as Humalog (insulin lispro) in a 10 mL 100 IU/mL vial.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nHumalog insulin lispro injection is used for the treatment of adults and children living with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. It has also shown effectiveness in helping prevent diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, although it has not been officially approved for the prevention of any of these conditions. It is indicated for the treatment of those people who need insulin for maintenance of blood sugar levels and also for the initial stabilization of diabetes mellitus. It is short-acting, and it is meant for use together with a longer acting insulin, such as Humulin N (insulin isophane NPH), except when used in a subcutaneous (under the skin) insulin infusion pump.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nDiabetes arises due to either your pancreas not making enough insulin, or your body not responding properly to the insulin that is being produced by your body. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the sugar levels in your blood. It regulates the breakdown of food and facilitates the absorption of sugar from the blood into fat cells, liver cells and skeletal muscle cells.\n\nHumalog insulin lispro is a rapid-acting <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human insulin</a> analog used to help maintain your blood sugar levels during and after meals. Following subcutaneous injection, it begins to work in approximately 15 minutes, it achieves peak effectiveness about 30 to 70 minutes after injection, and it lasts a relatively short amount of time; 2-5 hours. Its rapid absorption and shortened delay of onset has advantages over naturally occurring, human insulin, which requires a longer wait period before the start of a meal after injection. This allows for a more flexible dosing schedule, so you can adjust your insulin according to any changes in your daily meal times.\n<h2><strong>Humalog side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site irritation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most common side effect of insulin lispro is hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms of which may include headache, fast heartbeat, nausea, hunger, drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, blurred vision, tremor, sweating, trouble concentrating, confusion, or seizure (convulsion).\n\nSkin irritation at the site of injection (local allergy) in patients is also common. Redness, itching and swelling can occur at your insulin lispro injection site. This usually settles in a few days to a few weeks. In some cases, it may be related to other things than the insulin lispro itself, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or due to a poor injection technique.\n\nOther common side effects can include hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood) and lipodystrophy (a disorder in fat production). Some serious side effects can include anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), and hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reaction).\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nIts rapid onset of activity requires that you take Humalog insulin lispro within 15 minutes of the start of a meal, and if necessary, it may be given shortly after a meal (within 20 minutes of the beginning of the meal).\n\nOnly use it if it is a clear and colorless solution. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, thick, or slightly colored, or if any solid particles are visible.\n\nIf mixing insulin, the shorter-acting insulin should be drawn into the syringe first, before the longer-acting insulin to prevent contamination of the vial. The mixing of the two insulins beforehand or just prior the injection should be on advice of your doctor. However, a consistent routine should be followed.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour doctor will tell you which <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/different-types-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">type of insulin</a> to use, how much, when to inject it and how often to inject it. Because each case of diabetes is different, this schedule has been personalized specifically for you. Your usual dose can be influenced by changes in your food, physical activity, or work schedule. Always carefully follow your doctor's directions. Some other things that may impact your dose are pregnancy, illness, other medications, exercise and travel.\n\nYour dose should be administered within 15 minutes before the start a meal or immediately after the meal. The injection goes into the subcutaneous tissue of your abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks. To decrease the risk of lipodystrophy (a disorder in fat production), change the injection site within the same region between injections. Generally, you should complement your short-acting Humalog dose with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nHumalog should not be used if your blood sugar is too low, or you are suffering from hypoglycemia. After you have your low blood sugar treated, follow your doctor’s instructions on how to use it. Your blood sugar levels can be influenced by stress, illness, medical procedures, exercise, alcohol use, or missing meals. Always ask your doctor before changing your insulin schedule or dose.\n\nHumalog should not be used if you have allergies to anything in Humalog products.\n\nNever share your injection pen, cartridge, or syringe with any other person, even if you have changed the needle.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,71.63,"Insulin Brands > Humalog, Insulin > Rapid Acting",,,"https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/humalog-vials.jpg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/humalog-vials-1.jpeg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/humalog-vials-2.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,"2:55.90,3:50.66,4:48.04,5:47.94,6:47.68,7:47.30,8:46.72,9:46.39,10:45.97",product/humalog-vial-100-units-ml,,,,,yes,,,,,,156,30,"Order Humalog (insulin lispro) at LOW PRICES with affordable shipping from Canadianinsulin.com - Your source for diabetes medication online.",on,,"Buy Humalog Insulin Vials Online From Canada | Low Cost",2022-03-21T15:41:52+00:00,,,,,,,,

Regular insulin (Humulin R) is also used for the treatment of the two diabetic emergencies, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</a> and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Both Humulin N and Humulin 30/70 mix are used to help you regulate high blood sugar levels in the treatment of your diabetes.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nDiabetes comes about either because your pancreas is not making sufficient insulin, or the cells in your body are not responding correctly to the insulin that is being produced. Insulin is a hormone created by the beta cells in your pancreas, which is a large organ near your stomach. Insulin controls sugar levels in the blood by regulating the breakdown of food (sugars, fats and proteins), and stimulating the absorption of sugars from the blood stream into fat, liver and musculoskeletal cells.\n\nHumulin 30/70 mix has a similar mode of action to naturally occurring insulin. It begins to work approximately 30 to 60 minutes after administration, has its maximum effect between 2 and 8 hours after injection, and it stops working approximately 18 to 24 hours later.\n\nThe onset and duration of action comes from the mix of both Regular insulin (Humulin R) and isophane insulin (<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-humulin-n-nph-insulin-u-100-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Humulin N</a>). Regular insulin is a short acting insulin that begins working within 30 minutes and is active for about 5 to 8 hours, while insulin isophane (NPH) is an intermediate–acting insulin that starts to work within 90 minutes, peaks around about 6 to 10 hours and lasts approximately 24 hours.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects</h3>\nHypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is the most common side effect experienced by Humulin users. It can be a result of:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Taking too much insulin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Skipping or delaying meals</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>An infection or illness (especially with diarrhea or vomiting)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Exercising or working strenuously prior a meal</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Changes in your body’s insulin needs</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Insulin allergy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy/lipohypertrophy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is a serious diabetic condition that develops when your body does not produce enough insulin, and high levels of acids called ketones accumulate in your blood.\n\nA less common, but potentially very serious side effect, is a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to insulin. This can cause a rash all over your body, a fast pulse, shortness of breath, wheezing, sweating or decreased blood pressure. Severe cases of this reaction can be life threatening. If you have any of these symptoms and think you may be having an allergic reaction to your insulin, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nRarely, the administration of insulin under the skin can result in lipoatrophy, which is the localized loss of fat around the injection site. Lipohypertrophy is another rare reaction, which is the accumulation of fat under the skin around the injection site. If you notice either of these conditions, contact your doctor. Changing your injection technique and rotating your injection sites may help eliminate the problem.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nInsulin doses are measured in units. For example, U-100 insulin has 100 units/mL. It is important that you use a syringe that is marked for insulin preparations. If you do not use a proper syringe it can lead to mistakes in dosage, causing serious problems like blood sugar levels that are too high or too low.\n\nDo not use the Humulin 30/70 vial if, after re-refrigerating it, there are clumps or if any solid white particles stick to the bottom or side of the vial, giving it a frosted appearance.\n\nDisposable syringes and needles must only be used once and then thrown away safely. Needles and syringes must never be shared with anyone, including family members. You can pass on serious infections or get a serious disease from them. Follow your doctor’s directions and refer to the package insert section “proper use of this medication – injection procedures for vials”.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour Humulin 30/70 dosage is determined by your doctor, in accordance to your specific requirements and your specific prescription. Any changes in insulin dose or schedule should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. You may need to change your dosage or schedule if you switch to an insulin of a different strength, manufacturer, type, or method of manufacture. When taking Humulin 30/70, you may be required to change your dosage from what you used to take with other insulins. If you need a dose modification, it may occur with the first dose or during the first few weeks or months.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>This medication should not be:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Used if you are allergic to this drug or any of the ingredients used to formulate this medication</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Used if you see lumps that float or that stick to the sides of the vial</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Given intravenously (into the vein)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Used for treatment of diabetic coma</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Used during episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHumulin 30/70 should not be mixed with any other insulin unless clearly indicated and done under medical supervision. Any switches in insulin should be made cautiously and only with your doctor’s advice.\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Humulin 30/70 from Canada.

4247,simple,,"Humulin N Vials 100 Units/mL",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 1 Vial of 10 mL</h3>","<h2><strong>What are Humulin N vials?</strong></h2>\nHumulin N vials are vials filled with Humulin-N, which is the trade name of insulin isophane, otherwise known as <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NPH insulin</a>, which is used to control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It has been produced through genetic engineering, and is different from animal source insulin because it is structurally identical to the naturally occurring human insulin produced by your body. It is an intermediate-acting insulin with a slower onset of action than Regular insulin and a longer duration of activity. Humulin-N is a sterile suspension containing insulin isophane for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. It is available in 10 mL vials.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nHumulin N is an <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/intermediate-acting-insulin-types-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intermediate-acting insulin</a> administered subcutaneously (under the skin) that is used for the treatment of insulin requiring diabetic patients.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nHumulin N is the brand name of insulin isophane, or NPH insulin. This type of insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin, which is sometimes called basal, or background insulin, because it provides a long duration of insulin protection against your blood sugar level fluctuations throughout the entire day. After subcutaneous (under the skin) injection once or twice a day it typically begins to work in 90 minutes and lasts for approximately 24 hours. Humulin-N is structurally identical to naturally occurring human insulin, but it is mixed small proteins called protamines to help slow down the onset and increase the duration of insulin action.\n\nLike <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-analogs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">all insulin analogs</a>, Humulin-N simulates the activity of naturally occurring human insulin, which is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Insulin decreases the amount of sugar in your blood and urine by increasing the absorption of sugar from your blood into various tissues in your body, such as the liver, muscles, and fat. To help control your diabetes, your doctor has prescribed you injections of insulin to keep your blood sugar at a healthy level and to keep your urine as free of sugar as possible.\n<h2><strong>Humulin N Vials Side Effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Insulin allergy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia is the most common side effect of all insulin products. Your blood sugar should be carefully monitored. Uncorrected low blood sugar reactions can cause a loss of consciousness, coma or even death.\n\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"">Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</a> can occur if your body has not enough insulin, such as if you forget your insulin dose or take less than than you should, eat a lot more than your diet calls for, or develop a fever or infection. Symptoms come on slowly and may include a flushed face, thirst, loss of appetite and feeling drowsy. Having a quick pulse and heavy breathing are signs of more serious symptoms. If left untreated it can result in the loss of consciousness, coma, or even death. If you think you are experiencing any of these symptoms it is important that you get medical assistance immediately.\n\nA generalized allergy to insulin may cause a rash over your entire body, wheezing, shortness of breath, sweating, reduction in blood pressure or fast pulse. Generalized allergy reactions may be serious and require hospitalization. If you think you may be having a generalized allergic reaction to Humulin N, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nRarely, the subcutaneous injection of insulin can result in lipoatrophy, which is the local loss of fat around the injection site, or lipohypertrophy, which is the abnormal accumulation of fat underneath the surface of the skin. If you experience either of these conditions, contact your doctor. Changing your subcutaneous injection technique may help eliminate these problems.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nHumulin N should only be used if your doctor has prescribed you NPH insulin (insulin isophane). Humulin-N is a suspension which should be administered by subcutaneous (under the skin) injection only, preferably by yourself. Suitable subcutaneous administration sites are; thighs, the upper arms, abdomen or buttocks. Injection sites should be switched so that one same site is not used more than approximately once a month. Make sure that blood vessel, or muscle tissue has not been entered. Also, the injection site should not be massaged afterwards.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nIf you are a new patient receiving insulin for the first time you can be started on Humulin N in the same manner as you would be on <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/animal-insulin-types-production-side-effects"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">animal-source insulin</a>. You should be monitored closely during the adjustment period.\n\nIf switching from animal-source insulin to Humulin-N, it is possible that you will require a change in dosage; the adjustment may be made with the first dose or over a period of several weeks. Any change in insulin should be made cautiously and only under your doctor’s supervision.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>The drug should not be used:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>If you have any allergies to this drug or any of the ingredients used to formulate this medication</li>\n 	<li>Intravenously</li>\n 	<li>During episodes of hypoglycemia (too little sugar in the blood)</li>\n 	<li>For treatment of diabetic coma</li>\n 	<li>If after re-suspending, there are clumps floating in the insulin, or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or side of the vial giving it a frosted appearance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Humulin N from Canada.

It is an injectable medication used to control blood sugar levels in the treatment of diabetes. It contains zinc-insulin crystals dissolved in a clear fluid.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nHumulin R is used alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise to help improve blood sugar level control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also used to treat <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/gestational-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gestational diabetes</a> and diabetic complications, such as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) states. It may also be used in combination with glucose (sugar) to help lower potassium levels in those with hyperkalemia (high blood potassium).\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nHumulin-R is a short-acting insulin analog that begins working 30 minutes after injection, and it can last approximately 6 to 8 hours. It can give you protection against the blood sugar spikes that occur after meals, if you take it 30 to 60 minutes before the meal.\n\nThis medication works by mimicking the action of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">human insulin</a>, which is normally produced in your pancreas. Insulin lowers your blood sugar levels by absorbing sugar from your blood and converting it into cells that your fat, liver and muscles can use.

Your injection sites should be switched to make sure that the same site is not used more than about once a month. Make sure to not enter any blood vessels or muscle tissue. Your vial should be clear and colorless. Do not use it if it appears thickened, cloudy, slightly colored, or if solid particles are noticeable.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nSubcutaneous administration of Humulin-R is typically given three or more times a day before meals. Your dose and dosing schedule will likely be personalized and determined by your doctor for your individual needs. An average range of total daily insulin needs for maintenance therapy of insulin-treated diabetic patients that do not have severe insulin resistance is between 0.5 and 1 unit/kg/day.\n\nIf you are taking insulin for the first time, you should be carefully monitored by your doctor.\n\nIf you are switching from an <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/animal-insulin-types-production-side-effects"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">animal-source insulin</a> to Humulin R, you may need a change in dosage.

It is also known as a basal insulin as it provides insulin coverage consistently for a full day after a single daily injection. For every package of the Lantus SoloSTAR Pen, there are five insulin pens with 3ml of insulin glargine with a concentration of 100 units/ml.\n<h2><strong>What is Lantus SoloSTAR Pen used for?</strong></h2>\nLantus SoloSTAR Pen is used for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and also for neonatal diabetes mellitus. Lantus SoloSTAR Pens are typically used with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hypoglycemic medications</a> such as metformin and other insulin injection types such as fast-acting (e.g. insulin aspart) or intermediate-acting insulin (e.g. insulin aspart protamine). This is to help ensure that the blood sugar levels remain within the normal range throughout the day, especially after meals.\n<h2><strong>Why use it?</strong></h2>\nInsulin glargine in the Lantus SoloSTAR Pen has a relatively consistent concentration over time that closely mimics the normal physiological release of insulin in the human body, so patients can expect a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, the pen can be used with ultra-fine needles that make the injection process less painful. The font used in the dosing window is largely printed and clearly displayed, which helps ensure the correct dose. The turn-based mechanism to adjust the dose and the push-button injection feature are ergonomically constructed to ensure ease-of-use.\n\nInsulin glargine permits a once daily administration, it has less variability in its action in different patients, and has a significantly lower risk of hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia. Patients on other forms of insulin are also more prone to weight gain issues. Not to mention that you can receive greater discounts if you buy more than one Lantus SoloSTAR Pen at a time.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Lantus SoloSTAR Pens from Canada.

4254,simple,,"Lantus Vial 100 Units/ml",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 1 10 mL Vial</h3>","<h2>What is Lantus (insulin glargine) Vial?</h2>\nLantus vial contains Lantus insulin, which is a brand name of insulin glargine, a long-acting insulin analog. Its absorption, distribution and metabolism in the body is very similar to naturally occurring human insulin produced in people who do not have diabetes.\n<h2>What is it used for?</h2>\nLantus is used for the control of high blood sugar levels in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. It is also prescribed for adults and children (aged 6 years and older) with type 1 diabetes who require a long-acting insulin. It supplies a slow, consistent release of insulin all day to help regulate your blood sugar levels between meals and overnight. Your treatment may also require the support of a fast-acting mealtime insulin to help control blood sugar level spikes during meals. Lantus is typically used as a once daily, self-administered injection. It is not used for the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">treatment diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</a>.\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\nLantus works by simulating the action of naturally occurring insulin, which normally controls blood sugar levels in the body. The primary function of insulin (including insulin glargine, the kind used in Lantus) is the regulation of sugar metabolism. It lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating blood sugar absorption from the blood into skeletal muscle and fat cells, and by blocking sugar production by the liver. Studies have shown that insulin glargine and naturally occurring human insulin have the same effectiveness and ability to lower blood sugar levels. Compared with <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH human insulin</a>, subcutaneously injected insulin glargine has a slightly slower onset and a longer duration of action. This is because of the microcrystals in its formulation that slowly release the insulin, giving a long duration of action of 18 to 26 hours, with a relatively steady effect profile and little peak of action.\n<h2>Lantus side effects</h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hyperglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia, otherwise known as low blood sugar, is one of the most common side effects experienced by insulin users. It can develop because of stress, illness, taking too much insulin, skipping or forgetting meals, increased exercise, using a new type of insulin and taking other medication, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, herbs, vitamins and street drugs.\n<h4>Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>disorientation</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>convulsions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>loss of consciousness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>seizures.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nOn the other hand, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may develop if your body has too little insulin.\n<h4>Symptoms of hyperglycemia may include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>drowsiness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>increased thirst</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>decreased appetite</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>flushed dry skin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>quickened heart rate</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>increased urination</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dehydration</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>blurred vision</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>a fruity breath odor.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf left untreated, hyperglycemia can progress into diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and result in unconsciousness and death.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can develop from poorly controlled or uncontrolled diabetes. It occurs when your body does not have enough insulin, which can occur if you miss your insulin dose or take a smaller dose, eat too much, or develop an infection or fever.\n<h4>Symptoms of DKA come on gradually and may include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>thirst</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>flushed face</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>feeling drowsy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>loss of appetite.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf you have a rapid pulse with heavy breathing that may be a sign of a more serious condition. If left untreated, loss of consciousness, coma, or even death can result. If you think you may be experiencing any of these symptoms, get medical assistance immediately.\n\nPossible reactions on the skin at the injection site can include lipoatrophy, the localized loss of fat around the injection site that can look like depression in the skin, and lipohypertrophy, which is the accumulation of extra fat at the injection site which may look like a small lump. Other localized skin reactions may include swelling, itching and redness at injection site.\n<h2>How to take this medication</h2>\nLantus is taken as a subcutaneous injection, and the injection sites within each injection area (abdomen, thigh, buttock or deltoid) must be changed from one injection to the next. After injection, the area must not be massaged or rubbed. Speak to your doctor if you are not sure how to use this medication.\n\nLantus should only be used if the solution is clear and colorless with no particles or clumps visible. It is a clear solution, not a suspension like some other insulin products.\n<h2>Dosage</h2>\nMany factors can affect your usual Lantus dose, which include changes in your diet, activity level, or work schedule. Other factors that may affect your dose are illness, pregnancy, medication, exercise, and travel.\n\nLantus is taken subcutaneously, once a day, at any time during the day as long as it is taken at the same time every day.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes but have not been prescribed insulin before, you may be started at a dose of 10 U, once daily, and then have your dose subsequently adjusted according to your insulin needs. If you are changing over to Lantus from treatment with another intermediate or long-acting insulin, the amount and timing of that previous dose may need to be adjusted to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia.\n<h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2>\n<h3>The drug should not be used:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>If you are allergic to this drug or to any ingredient in the formulation or component of the container</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>If you have diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>For intravenous or intramuscular injections</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Before you use it, talk to your doctor if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>You are planning to have a baby, are pregnant, or are nursing a baby</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>You are taking any medication</strong></li>\n</ul>",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,141.00,"Insulin Brands > Lantus, Insulin > Long Acting",,,"https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lantus-vial.jpg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lantus-vial-1.jpeg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lantus-vial-2.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,"2:104.58,3:99.34,4:96.72,5:96.10,6:96.45,7:96.15,8:96.04,9:95.58,10:95.22",product/lantus-vial-100-units-ml,,,,,yes,,,,,,153,30,"Buy Lantus (insulin glargine) vials at *low prices* with affordable U.S. shipping from canadianinsulin.com - Your source for diabetes medication online.",on,,"Buy Lantus 100 Units Vials from Canada Online | Low Cost",2021-08-10T21:24:39+00:00,,,2,,,,,

They both are used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus because they have similar effects to naturally occurring insulin in their ability to reduce the level of sugar in the blood and urine.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge 30/70 is used for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the control high blood sugar. The combination of a fast- and intermediate-acting insulin is used for full day insulin control of your blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge 30/70 works the same way naturally occurring <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human insulin</a> does. In people who have diabetes, some don’t make enough of their own insulin and others cannot use the insulin their body makes properly. Normally insulin is produced by the pancreas, which is a large organ near the stomach. Insulin is important in metabolism, as it controls the breakdown of food, such as fats, proteins and sugars. It promotes the absorption of sugar from out of your blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells, and also blocks your liver’s ability to produce and release sugar back into your blood. Without insulin, the sugar is trapped in your bloodstream and cannot enter the cells of your body to be used for energy.\n\nNovolin ge 30/70 is a mixture of Regular insulin (30%) and NPH or insulin isophane (70%). Regular insulin also known as neutral or soluble insulin, is a type of fast-acting insulin that is structurally identical to naturally occurring human insulin. It has a typical onset of about 30 minutes and a duration of action up to 8 hours. NPH insulin is an intermediate–acting insulin that is made from Regular insulin mixed with protamines, which are small proteins that help to slow down its onset and to increase its duration of action. The typical onset of effects is usually within 90 minutes and can last up to 24 hours.\n\nWhen coupled together, Regular and NPH insulin add superior blood sugar level protection by combining the rapid effects of Regular insulin with the extended release of insulin of NPH insulin. Together they can help you can better match your insulin levels to simulate the action of naturally occurring insulin activity. This prevents the fluctuations in blood sugar levels seen with other man-made insulin alone, thereby reducing the effects of your diabetes symptoms all day with one dose.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Serious allergic reaction</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Local allergic reaction</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Swelling of your hands and feet</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heart Failure</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Vision changes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include:</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Excessive hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Troubles with concentration</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Tingling of tongue and lips</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Fast heart beat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Slurring speech</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Irritability, anxiety or changes in mood</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n</ul>\nYou may be experiencing a serious allergic reaction, otherwise known as a whole body reaction if you have trouble breathing, get a rash over your whole body or have a fast heartbeat. Get help immediately if you have any of these side-effects.\n\nInjection site reactions may include swelling, itching and redness at the injection site. If you continue having skin irritations or they become worse contact your doctor. Another injection site reaction that can occur is called lipodystrophy which is the appearance of thicker skin or pits at the injection site. Changing your injection site can help prevent these skin reactions from occurring. Do not inject insulin into skin that is swollen, red or itchy.\n\nHypokalemia is the appearance of low potassium levels in your blood. Symptoms of which may include feeling weakness, tired, leg cramps and constipation.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge 30/70 is a milky or cloudy suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc added. The insulin substance, which is the cloudy material, can settle at the bottom of the vial, therefore it must be rotated up and down so that the contents are uniformly mixed before you give yourself a dose. The vials come in 10 mL quantities and a for the use with a syringe.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nDosages are personalized based on your personal metabolic needs, blood sugar monitoring, blood sugar control, type of diabetes you have and your history of treatment and use of insulin. Make sure to closely monitor your blood sugar levels if you are switching to Novolin ge 30/70 during the initial weeks thereafter.\n\nYour doctor should have discussed with you the type, strength and amount of insulin you should use and the time(s) at which you should inject it, and also discussed with you a healthy diet and regular exercise schedule.\n\nWhenever you use Novolin ge 30/70, be sure to eat a meal within 45 minutes. Never use extra medicine to make up for a missed dose.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not take this insulin if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Your have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li>\n 	<li>You are allergic to anything in Novolin ge 30/70</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Let your doctor know:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>About all of your medical conditions</li>\n 	<li>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>About all of the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements</li>\n</ul>\nTaking a class of <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetes-medications-list"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diabetes medications</a> called thiazolidinediones (<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">TZDs</a>) along with Novolin ge 30/70 has the potential to cause heart failure.

They are filled with a mixture of 40% Regular insulin and 60% NPH insulin isophane suspension. Both <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/different-types-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">types of insulin</a> are man-made and are similar to naturally occurring human insulin. They are used to help control blood sugar levels for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Regular insulin is a short-acting insulin with a quick onset and a relatively short duration of action. NPH, or isophane insulin, is an <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/intermediate-acting-insulin-types-onset-peak-duration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intermediate–acting</a> man-made insulin with a longer onset and a duration that lasts a full day.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge PenFill Cartridges are for use in a reusable insulin pen to help with the regulation of high blood sugar levels in patients who require insulin for the treatment of their diabetes. The fast-acting Regular insulin, along with the intermediate-acting NPH insulin, provides you with an entire day’s worth of insulin control for your blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nDiabetes is brought about either because your pancreas is not making enough insulin, or because the cells in your body are not responding correctly to the insulin that is produced. Insulin itself is a hormone that is produced by the beta cells in your pancreas. It controls the sugar levels in your blood by regulating the breakdown of food, like sugars, fats and proteins, and it stimulates the absorption of sugars out of the blood and into fat, liver and musculoskeletal cells.\n\nNovolin ge 40/60 mix has a similar mode of action to naturally occurring insulin. Its onset and duration of action comes from the combination of the specific characteristics of both Regular insulin and NPH insulin. Regular insulin is a short-acting insulin that begins to work within 30 minutes, and it remains active for about 5 to 8 hours, while NPH insulin is an intermediate–acting insulin that starts to work after 90 minutes and peaks around 6 to 10 hours. The combination of these insulins can help you maintain your sugar levels for up to 24 hours.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Serious allergic reaction</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Swelling of your hands and feet</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Vision changes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heart Failure</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include:</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Slurred speech</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dizziness or lightheadedness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Shakiness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hunger</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Trouble concentrating or confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Fast heart beat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Anxiety, irritability or mood changes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Tingling of lips and tongue</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction are</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>rapid heartbeat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>rash over your whole body</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>trouble breathing.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf you experience any of these side effects, immediately contact your doctor.\n<h4>Injection site reactions, or local allergic reactions, may include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>itching</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>swelling</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>redness around your injection site.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf you continue having skin problems, or they become serious, get in contact with your doctor. Do not inject into skin that is itchy, red or swollen.\n\nLipodystrophy is a possible reaction as well, causing either lipoatrophy or lipohypertrophy. Lipoatrophy is the localized loss of fat around the injection site, causing pits in your skin. Lipohypertrophy is the accumulation of extra fat at the injection site, causing skin to rise. Remember to change your injection site every time you administer your insulin in order to help prevent these issues from occurring. If you have any of these skin issues, do not inject your insulin directly into this type of skin.\n\nHypokalemia is a potentially severe side effect that occurs when you have low potassium (K+) levels in your blood. Symptoms of hypokalemia can include constipation, feeling tired, weakness and leg cramps.\n\nSerious heart issues can occur in some people who are also taking <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic drugs</a> called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">thiazolidinediones</a> (TZDs) along with Novolin ge cartridges. This can occur even if you have never had any heart issues, and if you have, it can make them worse. Tell your doctor if you have any symptoms of heart failure, which include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Sudden weight gain</li>\n 	<li>Swelling in your feet or ankles</li>\n 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nThe insulin inside Novolin ge PenFill Cartridges is cloudy or milky with the addition of protamine and zinc. The insulin (the cloudy material) may sink and settle at the bottom of the cartridge, so it must be shaken up and down until the contents of the cartridge are uniformly mixed before you give yourself a dose. Insulin Novolin ge PenFills come in a 3 mL cartridge for use with your reusable insulin pen.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour dose and dosing schedule are individualized for you based on your own metabolic needs, type of diabetes, blood sugar level monitoring, and your history of treatment and use of insulin. You always need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely, especially if you are switching to Novolin ge cartridges from another insulin.\n\nYour doctor will have discussed with you already the strength, type and amount of insulin you should be using and your dose schedule. It is likely that you will not be on a strict time-based dosing schedule with Novolin ge, but make sure to eat a meal within 45 minutes of administration. Do not use more medicine to make up for a previously skipped dose.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nDo not take this insulin medication if you are allergic to anything in the Novolin ge PenFill Cartridge or if you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).\n<h3>Inform your doctor:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>About all of your medical conditions</li>\n 	<li>About all of the medications you are taking, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and supplements</li>\n 	<li>If you are pregnant, are planning to become pregnant or are breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Novolin ge PenFill Cartridges from Canada.

The vials come in 10 mL sizes.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection used for the treatment of diabetes in insulin requiring diabetic patients. <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH insulin</a> is typically used along with a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fast-acting insulin</a> to help cover your insulin needs for the blood sugar fluctuations seen during and after eating.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge NPH works like naturally occurring human insulin does, only longer. Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells in your pancreas that is mainly involved in your food metabolism. It helps your body use and store the sugar it gets from what you eat. For those with diabetes, either your pancreas does not make enough insulin or your body cannot use properly the insulin that is made. As a result, your sugar cannot be properly stored or used causing it to build up in your blood.\n\nNovolin ge NPH insulin is taken by people who have diabetes as a substitute for their lack of insulin. It is an intermediate-acting insulin sometimes called a basal or background insulin because it provides a full day’s worth of insulin action for your daily blood sugar level changes. After injection it usually takes 90 minutes to start working, then reaches its maximum effect between five and eight hours after and stops working after approximately 18 to 24 hours. Novolin ge NPH is structurally identical to <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human insulin</a>, but it has small proteins that are called protamines mixed in to give it a longer length of insulin action.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Insulin allergy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia, or low blood sugar is the most common side effect of insulin products including NPH insulin. Therefore, your blood sugar levels should always be monitored carefully. Untreated low blood sugar can cause unconsciousness, coma or even death.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA, can happen if you do not have enough insulin, such as if you skip your dose or take an insufficient dose, get a fever or infection or eat too much. Symptoms typically come on slowly and may include thirst, feeling drowsy, flushed face, and the loss of appetite. If these symptoms are left untreated the loss of consciousness, coma, or even death can result. Get medical assistance immediately If you think you are experiencing any of these symptoms.\n\nA generalized insulin allergy can cause a rash over your whole body, sweating, shortness of breath, a drop in blood pressure, wheezing or quick pulse. These types of generalized allergy reactions can be severe and require the need for hospitalization. If you think you are having a generalized allergy reaction to Novolin ge NPH, make sure to contact your doctor immediately.\n\nRarely the subcutaneous injections can cause a skin condition called lipoatrophy, the localized loss of fat near your injection site, or lipohypertrophy, the accumulation of extra fat under the surface of the skin. If you experience any of these skin conditions contact your doctor immediately. A change in your injection technique may help to eliminate, or reduce these types of issues.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nThe contents of your vial of Novolin ge NPH insulin should be cloudy and white.\n<h3>Do not use it if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>It looks grainy or lumpy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Seems very thick</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sticks to the vial</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Appears discolored</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Contains any crystals</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>The vial looks frosted, also do not use it</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>It remains clear after being rolled or rotated</strong></li>\n</ul>\nFatty tissue under your skin at the injection site can thicken (lipohypertrophy) or shrink (lipoatrophy) if you inject yourself too often at the same spot. To help avoid this, change your injection site with each injection. Talk to your doctor if you notice your skin thickening or pitting at your injection site.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour dose and schedule is individualized for you based on your specific metabolic needs, type of diabetes, blood sugar level monitoring, and your history of treatment and use of insulin. Numerous factors can affect your insulin dose, some of which may include, changes in your activity level, diet, meal pattern, or work schedule. Some other factors that may affect your dosing are travel, pregnancy, medication and illness.\n\nIf you are taking insulin for the first time your dose of Novolin ge NPH can be the same as it would be on animal-source insulin. During this adjustment period when you are transitioning between insulin you should be carefully monitored.\n\nIf you are switching from another insulin to Novolin ge NPH you may need a change in dosage. Your dose adjustment change may be made with your first dose or over a the first few weeks. Any changes in your insulin or dose should be made carefully and under your doctor’s close supervision.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use this insulin if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are allergic to NPH insulin or any of the other ingredients</li>\n 	<li>You have diabetic coma or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</li>\n 	<li>You have low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make sure to tell your doctor:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>About all the medications you are taking (prescription and non-prescription, vitamins and supplements)</li>\n 	<li>About all of your medical conditions</li>\n 	<li>If you are pregnant, are planning to become pregnant or are breast-feeding</li>\n</ul>",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,74.48,"Insulin > Intermediate Acting, Insulin Brands > Novolin",,,"https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/novolin-ge-nph-vials.jpg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/novolin-ge-nph-vials-1.jpeg, https://canadianinsulin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/novolin-ge-nph-vials-2.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,"2:52.78,3:46.39,4:43.20,5:41.69,6:41,7:40.26,8:39.56,9:39.21,10:38.76",product/novolin-ge-nph-vials-100-units-ml,,,,,no,,,,,,152,30,"Buy Novolin ge NPH Vials at LOW PRICES with affordable U.S. shipping from canadianinsulin.com - Your source for diabetes medication online.",on,,"Buy Novolin ge NPH Vials Online - Low Canadian Prices",2021-08-10T21:24:39+00:00,,,2,,,,,

It is a biosynthetic human insulin bioengineered using baker’s yeast that is structurally identical to naturally occurring <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human insulin</a>. The vials come in 10 mL sizes.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge Toronto is used to treat type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/gestational-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gestational diabetes</a>, and diabetic complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. It may also be used in combination with glucose (sugar) to lower potassium (K+) levels in those with hyperkalemia.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nRegular insulin, sometimes called neutral or soluble insulin, is a type of short-acting man-made insulin. After injection Regular insulin has an onset of action 30 minutes and a duration of activity that lasts about 6 to 8 hours. It can be used as a mealtime insulin to help protect you against the blood sugar level spikes observed after meals if you take it at least 30 minutes before your meals. Regular insulin is a bioengineered insulin that works by simulating the action of naturally occurring insulin which is normally produced in an organ near your stomach called the pancreas. When sugar builds up in your bloodstream, it is not available for your cells to use it as energy. Insulin lowers your blood sugar levels by increasing the absorption of sugar from out of your blood into other tissues in your body, such as fat, liver and muscle cells.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Lipoatrophy or lipohypertrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Insulin allergy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia is when you have low blood sugar and is the most common side effect of all <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-insulin-injection-medications-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">insulin products</a> including Novolin ge Toronto. It may occur because you are taking too much insulin, missing or delaying meals, strenuously exercising or working too hard just prior a meal, or because you have an infection or illness. You should always carefully monitor your blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar, if left untreated, can lead a loss of consciousness, coma or even death.\n\n<a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Diabetic ketoacidosis</a>, or DKA is a serious condition that occurs when your do not have enough insulin in your body. This can happen if you forget your dose or take less insulin than you are prescribed, eat a lot more than you should or you develop a fever or infection. The symptoms usually come on slowly and may include a flushed face, thirst, loss of appetite and feeling drowsy. If left uncontrolled it can result in the unconsciousness, coma, or even death. Contact your doctor immediately if you feel you may be experiencing these symptoms.\n\nA less common, but potentially dangerous side effect is a generalized insulin allergy otherwise called anaphylaxis, which may cause sudden drop in blood pressure, sweating, wheezing, a rash or hives over your body, a faster pulse or a shortness of breath. Generalized allergy reactions are serious and require immediate treatment. If you think you may be having a generalized allergic reaction seek medical help immediately.\n\nThe subcutaneous injection of Novolin ge Toronto can also result in localized skin reactions such as lipoatrophy, which is the loss of fat around the injection site, or lipohypertrophy, which is the accumulation of fat near the injection site. Call your doctor if you experience either of these side effects. Changing your injection technique may help eliminate or reduce these localized skin reactions.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nNovolin ge Toronto is for the subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. To help avoid skin site reactions remember to change or rotate your injection site within the same region. The best places to administer your injection are:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Your buttocks</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Your upper arm</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>The front of your thigh</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Your abdomen</strong></li>\n</ul>\nRemember that insulin works faster when you inject it around your waist.

4263,simple,,"Insulin Novomix 30/70 Penfill Cartridge",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with five 70/30 cartridges x 3 mL each</h3>","<h2><strong>What are NovoMix 30 Penfill Cartridges?</strong></h2>\nNovoMix 30 are cartridges filled with NovoLog Mix 70/30, which is a mixture of 70% insulin aspart protamine and 30% soluble insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fast-acting mealtime insulin analog</a> that is nearly identical to naturally occurring human insulin. Insulin aspart protamine is an intermediate-acting insulin analog that has small proteins called protamines added to slow down insulin aspart’s onset and to extend its duration of action.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovoMix 30 penfill cartridges are for use with your insulin pen in the treatment of patients with diabetes. It has a rapid onset and an intermediate duration of action which means it can be used to control your blood sugar levels during meals and also between meals and at nighttime.\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\nNovoMix 30 is a blood sugar-lowering mixture of man-made insulins that has a rapid onset and an intermediate duration of action. Its primary action is the regulation of sugar breakdown from the food you eat. All types of insulin including NovoMix 30 work by activating mechanisms in your body that lower blood sugar. They increase the absorption of sugar from the blood and into fat and skeletal muscle while also blocking the production and release of sugar from the liver into the blood.\n\nThe rapid absorption of insulin aspart itself is maintained by NovoMix 30. The insulin aspart component (30%) of the mixture is absorbed more rapidly from than naturally occurring <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">human insulin</a> and begins to work within 15 minutes. The remaining 70% of the mixture is insulin aspart protamine which has a long absorption profile lasting up to 24 hours. The peak activity of NovoLog Mix 70/30 is between one to four hours after subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.\n<h2>Novomix side effects</h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Edema</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThe most common side effect of insulin is <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hypoglycemia</a> (low blood sugar).\n<h3>Some signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>irritability</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>anxiety</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>mood changes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWith all treatments that include injections there is a potential for injection site reactions. Some common reactions include pain, swelling, redness, itching, inflammation, bruising and hives. If you consistently rotate your injection sites you can reduce you risk of developing any of these kind of skin site reactions. These reactions usually go away within a few days to weeks. Repeated subcutaneous injections can also result in a group of localized skin reactions called lipodystrophy. This can look like skin thickening (lipohypertrophy) or pits (lipoatrophy) at the injection site. A change in your subcutaneous injection technique may help to reduce the risk of getting these reactions.\n\nHypokalemia is the occurrence of excessively low potassium (K+) levels in your blood. All insulin therapies tend to cause a shift in potassium levels which can potentially lead to hypokalemia. If your blood potassium levels are left untreated it may lead to respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia and even death.\n\nEdema is fluid retention which causes swelling which can occur during insulin therapy. It can occur in any part of your body, though its most observable in the legs and arms, including the feet, ankles and hands.\n\nTaking <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">antidiabetic medications</a> called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">thiazolidinediones</a> (TZDs) together with NovoMix 30 causes a risk of heart failure even if you never have had heart issues before. Let your doctor know if you have any signs or symptoms of heart failure which may include:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Swelling in your feet or ankles</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Sudden weight gain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Shortness of breath</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nBefore use inspect your cartridge, its should be uniformly cloudy and white. If it is clear or contains solid particles, do not use it. NovoMix 30 must be re-suspended immediately before use. Re-suspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature.\n\nThis drug is for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection into the buttocks, abdominal region, upper arm or thigh. You should remember to rotate your injection sites from one injection to the next to reduce the chance of getting lipodystrophy. Do not administer it intravenously or use it in insulin infusion pumps.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nNovoLog Mix 70/30 helps you control your mealtime blood sugar levels and also helps you control your blood sugar levels between meals too. It is usually taken twice-daily, with each dose intended to cover two meals or a meal plus a snack. You should administer your dose within 15 minutes before your meal starts. For treatment of type 2 diabetes the dose may be given after the start your meal.\n\nIndividual dosing schedules will vary among patients and should be determined by your doctor who is familiar with your eating habits, metabolic needs and other lifestyle variables. With all insulin therapies the action of the insulin can change according to the injection site, dose, temperature, blood flow and your level of physical activity.\n\nYour individualized dosage schedule is based on your metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, blood sugar level control goals. Dosage adjustments may be needed if you are switching from another <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/different-types-insulin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">type of insulin</a>, or with any changes in physical activity, meal pattern, kidney or liver function or during sickness.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nNever share your insulin pen with anyone, even if you have changed the needle. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of infections to others and from them to yourself.\n<h3>Do not take it if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li>\n 	<li>Have allergies to any of the ingredients</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tell your doctor if you are:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are currently breast-feeding</li>\n 	<li>Taking a new prescription or over-the-counter drug or supplement</li>\n</ul>\nDo not drive or operate machinery until you know how it affects you.

4687,variable,,"Adlyxin (Lixisenatide) Pens",1,0,visible,,"<h2>What is Adlyxin?</h2>\nAdlyxin (lixisenatide) belongs to a class of drugs called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs/"">glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)</a> receptor agonists. This injectable medication may help patients with <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment/"">type 2 diabetes</a> control blood sugar levels.\n<h2>What is it used for?</h2>\nAdlyxin is prescribed to adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is used as an adjunctive treatment to exercise and diet for the improvement of blood glucose control. The drug is not indicated for the treatment of type I diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Adlyxin should not be used in patients who have chronic pancreatitis (or previously had unexplained pancreatitis). Similarly, Adlyxin should not be used in the presence of gastroparesis. Keep in mind that Adlyxin is not a substitute for insulin injections.\n<h2>How to take this medication</h2>\nPrior to use, patients (and caregivers, if any) should be trained to prepare and use the pen correctly. A practice injection should be performed as part of the training. As with other injections, it is important to inspect the solution before use. Make sure the solution is colorless, clear and particulate free.\n\nInject Adlyxin subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen, using a different injection site each time. Patients are advised to rotate between injections sites (they should not inject into the same site for each dose). Adlyxin should be used one hour prior to the first meal of the day. In the case of a missed dose, patients should use the injectable one hour before the next meal. To ensure the safe use of Adlyxin, patients should not share their pens under any circumstances.\n<h2>How does this drug work?</h2>\nAdlyxin contains lixisenatide as its medicinal ingredient. Through the agonism of GLP-1 receptors, Lixisenatide is able to decrease glucagon secretion and increase glucose-dependent insulin. It is believed that lixisenatide promotes glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis by beta islet cells, resulting in an increased glucose uptake. Ultimately, this leads to a drop in blood sugar levels. Plus, lixisenatide is known to slow gastric emptying. By activating the GLP-1 receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, Adlyxin delays gastric emptying, thereby controlling postprandial blood sugar levels.\n\nChemically, lixisenatide is able to activate adenylyl cyclase, subsequently increasing the concentration of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This leads to the activation of several chemical substances (e.g. protein kinase A or PKA, Epac1 and Epac2), all of which are involved in the “amplification” pathway. The activation of this amplification pathway will contribute to the increase of glucose-stimulated <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-synthesis-secretion/"">insulin secretion</a>.\n<h2>Dosage</h2>\nInitially, it is recommended to use Adlyxin once a day for two weeks. Then, from day-15 onwards, use a maintenance dose of 20mcg once per day.\n<h2>Side effects</h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling dizzy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIn order to prevent allergy reaction, Adlyxin should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to lixisenatide or any other inactive ingredients. Patients who had angioedema or anaphylaxis from the use of another GLP-1 receptor agonist should be monitored closely while they are on Adlyxin. They may be more susceptible to developing anaphylaxis.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of all the possible side effects of Adlyxin. Some patients may experience side effects other than the ones listed in this section.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"Non-Insulin Injectables",,,,,,,,,,,,0,,product/buy-adlyxin-pens,Strength,"50 mcg / ml, 100 mcg / ml",1,0,yes,,,,,,180,60,"You can buy Adlyxin Pens from us and order online.

Exenatide is a synthetic peptide that belongs to a category of medication known as incretin mimetics. Its mechanism of action closely mimics the activity of incretin hormones like <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GLP-1</a>. The incretin hormone is vital for promoting the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner, as well as other antihyperglycemic actions.\n<h2><strong>Why is the Byetta used?</strong></h2>\nOnce administered, exenatide stimulates the pancreatic beta cells to release more glucose-dependent insulin; suppress elevated glucagon secretion; and delay gastric emptying. As a result, blood glucose levels are maintained within the normal range.\n\nThis medicine is indicated to be used as part of a comprehensive diabetes management program along with diet modification and adequate exercise for better glycemic regulation in type 2 diabetic patients. The Byetta Injection Pen is not a substitute for insulin and should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nEach Byetta Injection Pen is prefilled with sterile, clear, colorless, and particle-free solution. The pen comes in two sizes, 1.2ml (5mcg per dose) and 2.4ml (10mcg per dose). Both sizes deliver 60 doses for 30 days of use. The initial dosage of Byetta is 5mcg, which is administered twice daily via subcutaneous injection through the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. This injection can be given at any time within an hour before the morning or evening meals (or before two main meals, spaced six hours apart). The dosage may be increased to 10mcg twice daily based on patient’s response to the treatment.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling jittery</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dizziness and weakness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heartburn</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea and constipation</strong></li>\n</ul>\nPlease note that this is not a complete list of all the possible side effects of Byetta. Byetta may cause other side effects that are not included in this list. Patients should see a doctor if they experience any unusual or persistent symptoms.

Saxenda is an alternative to Victoza for people looking to manage their weight. <a title=""Victoza prices"" href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-victoza-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">You can buy Victoza here.</a>\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nSaxenda is used as a treatment for adults over 18 years old who are obese or overweight with a weight-related medical condition.\n\nIt is used for weight loss in adults with a BMI* of 27 or greater.\n\n* – BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. See your doctor to have your BMI measured.\n<h2><strong>How does the drug work?</strong></h2>\nSaxenda, combined with a low-calorie diet and exercise program, aims to help patients lose weight. In turn, the weight loss may help to regulate blood sugar and insulin levels.\n\nThis medication is an incretin mimetic that acts similarly to <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)</a>, which is naturally found in the body. GLP-1 enhances the secretion of insulin and lower blood sugar levels. Saxenda works to regulate the appetite, which in turn may inhibit glucagon production.\n\nFor it to be most effective, it should be taken with a reduced calorie diet and a regulated increase in physical activity.\n<h2><strong>How to inject this medication</strong></h2>\nPlease consult your doctor and read the packaging carefully for the appropriate use instructions. Do not use the pen without getting proper training from your doctor or diabetes nurse educator before using.\n\nCheck the pen to ensure that you have the correct medication, and that the solution is colorless. Discuss the appropriate needle size with your pharmacist prior to use. You can check the flow prior to use of each new pen by selecting the flow check symbol with the dose selector. A drop should appear at the tip of the needle. Select the dose specified by your doctor by centering the dose selector at the end of the pen. The pen delivers doses of 0.6mg, 1.2mg, 1.8mg, 2.4mg, and 3.0mg. Inject into the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh, unless specified otherwise by your health-care provider. Properly dispose of used needles.\n\nDo not use this pen without help if you have poor eyesight, or are blind. Your helper should be properly trained to administer the dose.\n\nDo not touch the dose counter, as this can affect the injection process. Do not share your medication with others, even if they have the same prescription.\n\nNeedles are not included with the pack.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour doctor will likely increase your dose slowly. The typical starting dose is 0.6mg injected once a day. Each week, the dose is increased until 3.0mg is reached. Do not adjust your dose unless specified by your doctor.\n\nInject into the appropriate area once a day, with or without food. Saxenda is prescribed with a low-calorie diet and regular exercise plan, which should be followed in order to increase the effectiveness of the medication.\n<h3><strong>Missed Dose:</strong></h3>\nIf you happen to miss your regular dose, do not double your next dose to make up for it. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, and take the next usual dose the following day. If you have missed your dose for 3 days or longer, contact your medical practitioner.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use it if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are allergic to any of Saxenda’s ingredients;</li>\n 	<li>You or any of your close family members have a history of medullary thyroid cancer;</li>\n 	<li>You have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2;</li>\n 	<li>You are currently pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is common to feel nauseous or to experience vomiting and diarrhea or constipation. These effects typically resolve themselves within a few weeks of beginning treatment.\n\nThose under the age of 18 should not use Saxenda.\n\nInform your doctor if you develop pain in the abdomen in addition to vomiting and/or nausea.\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Saxenda side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Most common effects:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Constipation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Common side effects:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Bloating, heartburn, gas, discomfort or inflammation in the stomach, indigestion, and upper stomach pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection-related reactions, including bruising, irritation, and rash</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Gallstones</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dry mouth</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Change in your sense of taste</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling tired or weak</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)*</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uncommon side effects:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Inflamed gallbladder</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Fast pulse</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Feeling unwell</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Dehydration</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rare negative effect may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Acute kidney failure (signs of which include metallic taste in mouth and easily bruising)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Reduced kidney function</strong></li>\n</ul>\n* – The warning signs of hypoglycemia can be sudden, and can include: headache, cold sweats, increased hunger, cool pale skin, nausea, fast heart beat, vision changes, nervous, anxiety, fatigue, feeling of weakness, confusion, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.

Its chemical name is dulaglutide, which belongs to the GLP-1 agonist family of drugs.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nTrulicity is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes in combination with:\n<ul>\n 	<li>A healthy diet and regular exercise in patients who cannot use <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/buy-metformin-diabetes-medication-500mg-850mg-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Metformin </a>due to a contraindication or an intolerance</li>\n 	<li>Metformin, when a healthy diet and regular exercise have not reached acceptable levels of blood sugar control</li>\n 	<li>Metformin and a sulfonylurea, when a healthy diet along with regular exercise plus dual therapy with Metformin and a sulfonylurea have not reached acceptable levels of blood sugar control</li>\n 	<li>Mealtime insulin with Metformin, when a healthy diet and regular exercise plus insulin therapy (up to two injections of mealtime insulin per day) with or without oral diabetes medications, have not reached acceptable levels of blood sugar control</li>\n</ul>\nTrulicity should not be used if you have type 1 diabetes, <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetic ketoacidosis,</a> or a history of severe gastrointestinal (GI) disease. This is not a substitute for insulin therapy, and has not been approved for use in children under 18 years of age.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nTrulicity belongs to a type of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GLP-1 receptor agonists (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists)</a>. It can help to lower your blood sugar levels by helping your body release more insulin when your blood sugar is high.\n\nIt increases the release of insulin by beta cells in the pancreas, slows the time it takes food to leave the stomach and also reduces glucagon secretion by the pancreas, which normally increases blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nTrulicity is a solution for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. It is available as single-use, pre-filled pens or single-use, pre-filled syringes in either 0.75 mg/0.5 mL or 1.5 mg/0.5 mL strengths. Each pen contains one weekly dose.\n\nDo not change your dose or stop treatment without speaking with your doctor first. Your doctor will likely start you on a healthy diet and regular exercise program. Stay on this program throughout your treatment unless advised otherwise by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will instruct you about how to properly use this product. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the instructions for use in the package. The injection pen has been shown to be easy to learn and easy to use. It is an injection which is given under the skin. Do not inject into your muscle or vein. Suitable injection sites are around your stomach area (abdomen), your upper leg (thigh),or your upper arm.\n<ul>\n 	<li>Change your injection site every week. Never use the same site for each injection</li>\n 	<li>You can give yourself the injection at any time of the day</li>\n 	<li>If you give yourself insulin along with Trulicity, do not mix them in the same container. Give yourself separate injections of both. You may give both injections in the same area of the body, but not the same injection site. For example, you may use your stomach area, but do not inject too close to one another.</li>\n 	<li>Never share your needles, pen, or syringe with another person. You may give another person an infection or get an infection from them, even if they are family</li>\n 	<li>Keep all pens and needles out of the reach of children</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nThe recommended starting adult dose is 0.75 mg once weekly administered subcutaneously (under the skin). Your dosage may be increased to 1.5mg once-weekly based on your blood sugar response. The maximum recommended dose is 1.5 mg once weekly. It can be taken any time of the day, with or without food.\n\nYour dose of Trulicity and other diabetic drugs you take may need to change because of changes in the level of physical activity or exercise, weight loss or gain, illness, increased stress, changes in diet, or because of the other medications you are taking. The response on your blood sugar control should be monitored by periodic measurements of blood sugar levels.\n<h3>Missed Doses:</h3>\nIf you happen to miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible if there are at least three days (72 hours) until your next scheduled dose. If there are less than three days remaining until your next scheduled dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose on the next regularly scheduled day. Do not take two doses within three days of one another. The dosing day of your weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as there are at least three days in between doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use this medication if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have allergies to this drug, or to any ingredient in the formulation or component of the container</li>\n 	<li>Or any family member has ever had medullary thyroid cancer</li>\n 	<li>Suffer from Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2)</li>\n 	<li>Are currently pregnant or breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Talk to your doctor about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Have type 1 diabetes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Are taking <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulfonylurea (e.g. glyburide, gliclazide, glimepiride)</a> or insulin</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have ever had diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketone level in your blood or urine)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have or have had pancreas problems such as inflammation of the pancreas</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have severe problems with your stomach (gastroparesis) or food digestion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have a fast pulse</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have any heart disease, angina, heart rhythm problems or congestive heart failure, or if you previously had a heart attack</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have kidney problems</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have liver problems</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have severe diarrhea or vomiting and dehydration</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Have bradycardia, otherwise called heart block</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Trulicity side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Abdominal pain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)*</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Decreased appetite</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Upset stomach</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Constipation</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Gas (flatulence)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Abdominal distension</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Heartburn</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Belching</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Fatigue</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Fast heartbeat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>First degree atrioventricular block (AV block)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rare negative effects include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n* When used in combination with other diabetic drugs, especially metformin, insulin, or secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylurea).\n\nTalk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

4697,variable,,"Victoza Pens 6 Mg",1,0,visible,,"<h2>What is Victoza?</h2>\nVictoza is a daily injectable prescription antidiabetic drug used to help improve blood sugar levels in <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-signs-symptoms-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">adults with type 2 diabetes</a>. It should be used together with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Its active ingredient is liraglutide.\n\nBoth Victoza 2-Pak and Victoza 3-Pak are available from us. Every pen contains a total of 3mL of liraglutide. The strength of Victoza is 6mg/ml, for a total strength of 18 mg in each pen. However, you can only choose from the following strengths for each injection: 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. Ask your doctor which dosage strength you should use.\n<h2>What is it used for?</h2>\nVictoza is typically used together with a healthy diet and regular exercise to improve blood sugar regulation in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is usually given after treatment with other diabetes medicines have been attempted without any success. It is not used for the <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/type-1-diabetes-symptoms-causes-treatments"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">treatment of type 1 diabetes</a>.\n<h2>Usage for weight loss</h2>\nMore recently, Victoza has been approved as a treatment to help you lose excess weight. It is specifically authorized for use in those people who are obese (with a Body Mass Index of 30 or greater), or overweight (with a Body Mass Index greater than 27), and the presence of at least one weight-related medical condition like high blood pressure, diabetes, or dyslipidemia (the abnormal presence of lipids in the blood). In order to help you with losing excess weight it should be used alongside a low-calorie meal plan together with increased physical activity.\n<h2>How does this drug work?</h2>\nVictoza (liraglutide) belongs to a class of medicines called <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GLP-1 analogues</a>, which help your body make more insulin when your blood sugar levels are high. It is very similar to a hormone that naturally occurs in the body to help control blood sugar, insulin levels, and digestion.\n\nLiraglutide leads to insulin release from beta cells in your pancreas when there are elevated levels of blood sugar, like after you eat a meal. The insulin release slows as your blood sugar levels decrease and approach normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon, which is also produced and released from the pancreas, works the opposite of insulin in that it increases blood sugar. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon production and release, and increases the rate at which food leaves the stomach (delays gastric emptying).\n<h2>How to take this medication</h2>\nMake sure to take your medicine exactly as your doctor has prescribed for you. It is an injection which must be given under the skin (subcutaneously). Be careful to never inject it into a vein or muscle.\n\nBefore you use the pen for the first time your doctor will show you how to properly use it. The best places to give yourself the injection are in the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen) or in your upper arm. The injection can be done at any time of the day. Never share your pen or needles with anyone else, including family members, even if you have changed the needle.\n<h2>Dosage</h2>\n<h3>Usual dose:</h3>\nVictoza can be administered at any time of the day and you take it with meals or without.\n\nThe typical starting dose is 0.6 mg once a day for at least the first week. Your doctor will tell you how long to keep taking this dose. Your dose may then be increased to 1.2 mg once a day. Your doctor may tell you to increase the dose If your blood sugar is not controlled well enough with a dose of 1.2 mg, up to 1.8 mg once a day. Do not change your dosage unless your doctor has specifically told you to. You will not need to test your blood sugar levels each day in order to adjust your dose, however, if you are taking a <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-sulfonylureas-drugs"">sulfonylurea medicine</a> as well, your doctor may advise you to test your blood sugar levels daily. This will help your doctor to decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea needs to be changed.\n<h3>Missed doses:</h3>\nIf you should happen to miss a dose, take your next dose on the next day as usual. Do not take an another dose or increase the dose on the following day to make up for the dose you missed. Do not stop using Victoza without talking to your doctor.\n<h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2>\n<h3>Do not use this drug if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are allergic to any of the ingredients</li>\n 	<li>You or any family member has or has had in the past medullary thyroid cancer</li>\n 	<li>You have MEN 2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2)</li>\n 	<li>You are breastfeeding or pregnant</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>To help avoid any side effects and to ensure proper use, make sure to talk to your doctor before taking Victoza. Talk about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have type 1 diabetes</li>\n 	<li>You or any family member has or has had in the past medullary thyroid cancer</li>\n 	<li>Have ever had <a href=""https://www.canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</a></li>\n 	<li>Have MEN 2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2)</li>\n 	<li>Have a high heart rate</li>\n 	<li>Have ever had an allergic reaction to liraglutide</li>\n 	<li>Have liver problems</li>\n 	<li>Have ever had pancreatitis</li>\n 	<li>Have any heart disease, such as angina, heart rhythm disturbances or congestive heart failure, or if you have ever had a myocardial infarction (heart attack)</li>\n 	<li>Have a condition called heart block (brachycardia)</li>\n 	<li>Have kidney problems</li>\n 	<li>Have severe diarrhea or vomiting or dehydration</li>\n 	<li>Have gastrointestinal problems</li>\n 	<li>Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you begin your treatment, you may experience some loss of fluids or dehydration, especially if you experience any diarrhea or vomiting. To avoid dehydration it is important to drink plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nLiraglutide may increase heart rate and could cause changes which are known as PR prolongation. Seldomly drugs with these effects cause changes in heart rhythm that result in dizziness, feeling of pounding, rapid or irregular heart beat, fainting or death. If you have heart disease, or if you are taking certain other drugs, these types of heart rhythm changes are more likely. It is important to follow your doctor’s advice about the dose of Victoza or about any special tests that you may need.\n\nTell your doctor about all the medications you take, including any minerals,vitamins, drugs, alternative medicines or natural supplements. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using a sulfonylurea medicine (such as glibenclamide or glimepiride) or insulin for the treatment of your diabetes.\n<h3>The medicine may interact with:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Drugs to treat hypertension</li>\n 	<li>Drugs to treat heart failure</li>\n 	<li>Drugs to treat HIV infection</li>\n 	<li>Drugs to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder</li>\n 	<li>Drugs to suppress appetite or cause weight loss</li>\n 	<li>Decongestants</li>\n 	<li>Drugs to treat asthma</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h2>Victoza side effects</h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Anorexia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Decreased appetite.</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Headache</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Vomiting</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Burping</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Indigestion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Inflamed stomach (gastritis)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) which includes heartburn</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Painful or swollen tummy (abdomen)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Constipation</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Flatulence</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Infection of the upper airways</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions (such as bruising, pain irritation, itching and rash)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Increased heart rate</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTalk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

4700,simple,,"Bydureon 2 mg",1,0,visible,,"<h2><strong>What is Bydureon (Exenatide)?</strong></h2>\nBydureon is a type of drug known as <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GLP-1 receptor agonist</a>. It is an extended release formulation of exenatide, a synthetic peptide amide made of 39 amino acids. This medication is used as a combination therapy with diet and exercise to help control blood sugar levels.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nMedically, Bydureon is used as an adjunctive treatment in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for better glycemic control. For optimal treatment outcomes, Bydureon should be used in conjunction with exercise and diet. Keep in mind that this medication does not replace insulin injections. It is not suitable for use in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis or type I diabetes mellitus.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nYour doctor will show you how to use this medication. Ensure to follow your doctor’s instructions. Bydureon should be administered immediately into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen area. Patients are advised to rotate between injection sites. When used in combination with an insulin injection, the drug should be injected separately. Bydureon and insulin should not be mixed into a single solution. While insulin and Bydureon can be administered into the same body area, the injection sites shouldn’t be adjacent to each other. This medication should not be administered via intravenous or intramuscular injections.\n\nIn the case of a missed dose, use Bydureon as soon as possible (provided the next dose is due at least three days later). Then, resume the normal dosing schedule (once weekly). If patients miss a dose and the next regular dose is due one or two days later, they should skip the missed dose and use the next dose like they normally would. Do not stop using this medication unless instructed to by a medical professional, even if you feel better.\n<h2><strong>How does Exenatide work?</strong></h2>\nBydureon contains exenatide as its medical ingredient. The sequence of amino acids in exenatide closely resembles that of human glucagon-like peptide-1. Exenatide attaches to human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, thereby activating them. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a type of incretin that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion. It also exhibits other anti-hyperglycemic actions after being released from the gut into the circulation. Functioning as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, Bydureon helps slow gastric emptying while enhancing glucose-dependent insulin release by the pancreatic beta cells. At the same time, it exerts a suppressive action on excessive glucagon secretion. It is believed the mechanism of action of Bydureon involves cyclic AMP (cAMP) and several other intracellular signaling pathways.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nIt is recommended to inject 2mg subcutaneously once every week. Bydureon can be used with or without meals at any time of day. If needed, the day of weekly injection can be changed (as long as the previous dose was injected at least three days before the new day of injection).\n<h2><strong>Bydureon Side effects</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Nausea and vomiting, constipation and diarrhea</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Indigestion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Itching</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Small bumps at the site of injection</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThis is not an exhaustive list of all the possible side effects of Bydureon.

6269,simple,,"NovoRapid (NovoLog) 100 Units / mL Vials",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 1 10 mL Vial</h3>","<h2><strong>What is NovoLog Vial?</strong></h2>\nNovoLog, known as NovoRapid in Canada, contains <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-aspart-onset-peak-time-duration-action-side-effects/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin aspart</a>, which is a <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fast-acting mealtime insulin</a>. Insulin aspart is a man-made insulin that is similar to naturally occurring human insulin. Only a single amino acid has been modified, compared to the structure of human insulin (which consists of 51 amino acids in total). This small change allows this medication to be absorbed quickly. It starts to work in minutes, which lets you eat soon after its administration.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovoLog is used for the control of blood sugar levels in adults and children with diabetes. It has a relatively low likelihood of causing hypoglycemia, which is low blood sugar, the most common side effect of insulin therapy.\n<h2><strong>How does this medication work?</strong></h2>\nNovoLog is a type of mealtime or bolus insulin, which works quickly to regulate blood sugar levels during and after eating. You can start to eat within 5 to 10 minutes after taking it, with its peak action taking effect between 45 to 90 minutes, while lasting approximately 3 to 5 hours. These times are based on averages and can vary due to which injection site you use, the temperature of the medication, your blood flow and exercise.\n\nNovoLog is similar in structure to naturally occurring insulin and works similarly, too. Naturally occurring insulin is a hormone produced in a large organ near the stomach called the pancreas. Insulin is mainly involved in the breakdown of food and the regulation of blood sugar levels. It promotes the absorption of sugar from the blood into liver, fat and muscle cells, and it also blocks sugar production in the liver. Sugar is the main energy source for your body, so when your body does not properly absorb sugar from your blood, there is a deficiency of the energy your body needs to function. When this deficiency occurs, the cells in your tissues do not have the necessary energy to perform all the basic functions your body needs.\n<h2><strong>NovoLog side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common side effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypogycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hyperglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Local allergic reaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia, or low blood sugar levels is the most common side effect of all <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/product-category/insulin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">insulin products</a>. It can cause sweating, convulsions, fatigue, heart palpitations, hunger, disturbed behavior, loss of consciousness, temporary or permanent impairment of brain function, or even death in extreme cases.\n\nNot taking enough insulin, or stopping you insulin treatment, especially if you have type 1 diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">diabetic ketoacidosis</a> (DKA). The first symptoms of high blood sugar come on slowly over a period of hours or days. They may include thirst, vomiting, increased frequency of urination, drowsiness, flushed and dry skin, nausea, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as an acetone odor of breath. In type 1 diabetes, untreated high blood sugar eventually leads to DKA, which is potentially lethal.\n\nAll insulin products cause a shift in potassium (K+) levels, which can lead to hypokalemia, or abnormally high levels of potassium in the blood. If left untreated it may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.\n\nAs with all insulin therapies, injection site reactions may occur, which may include pain, redness, itching, hives, swelling, bruising and inflammation. Constant rotation of your injection site within a given area reduces your risk of developing these reactions. These reactions usually resolve themselves in a few days to a few weeks. Changing your injection technique may help reduce the risk of getting these reactions.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nThe NovoLog 10 mL vial is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously) using a syringe, and it can also be used for continuous infusion with an insulin pump system. It starts to lower your blood sugar about 10 to 20 minutes after you take it, and should be given immediately before a meal because of its fast onset of action.\n<h2><strong>Dosing</strong></h2>\nYour NovoLog dose schedule has been created for you specifically by your doctor, based on your type of diabetes, personal metabolic needs, blood sugar level monitoring, and your history of treatment and use of insulin. Many factors can affect your dose, including your diet, illness, activity level, work schedule, other medications, pregnancy and travel. You should always closely monitor your blood sugar levels, especially if you are switching to NovoLog from another insulin. A longer-acting insulin is often used together with NovoLog to cover the periods of time between doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin aspart, metacresol or any of the other ingredients in the NovoLog vial</li>\n 	<li>You have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</li>\n 	<li>The insulin does not appear water-clear and colorless</li>\n 	<li>The vial is dropped, damaged or crushed</li>\n 	<li>The protective cap is loose or missing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Talk to your doctor if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Become sick</li>\n 	<li>Have any problems with your kidneys or liver</li>\n 	<li>Have problems with your pituitary, adrenal or thyroid glands</li>\n 	<li>Drink alcohol</li>\n 	<li>Drive, or use tools or machines</li>\n 	<li>Suffer from diarrhea, vomiting or eat less than usual</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant</li>\n 	<li>Are breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>Are planning to travel into a different time</li>\n 	<li>Have a fever, infection or have had surgery recently</li>\n 	<li>Are exercising more than usual or are planning to change your diet</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)</a>, alone or in combination with NovoLog, can cause heart failure and edema.

Insulin aspart is the chemical or generic name of NovoLog in the US. In Canada, it is known as NovoRapid (which is the product name you may receive when ordering NovoLog from CanadianInsulin.com). Insulin aspart is a man-made, <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fast-acting mealtime insulin</a> that is nearly identical in structure to naturally occurring human insulin. This insulin medication comes in a package of five FlexPens that have 3 mL of insulin aspart each.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nNovoLog is a <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">man-made insulin</a> that is used to regulate high blood sugar levels in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. The drug is an easy-to-use and convenient dial-a-dose insulin pen that allows you to take your mealtime dose at home or on the go.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nNovoLog (insulin aspart) is a fast-acting mealtime or “bolus” insulin, which begins to work within 5 to 10 minutes. Its peak effect is reached in about 45 to 90 minutes and it lasts about three to five hours. NovoRapid is taken for the control of your blood sugar during your meals. Insulin therapy that regulates your blood sugar levels between meals and during sleep is called long-acting or “basal” insulin. A regimen of a fast-acting insulin for meals, like Novolog, and a longer-acting basal insulin between meals is called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/basal-bolus-insulin-therapy-type-1-diabetes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Basal-Bolus Insulin Therapy</a>. This provides you protection against the blood sugar spikes that happen when you eat, and it also offers you a steady amount of insulin for blood sugar protection the entire day.\n\nIt is a pre-filled, disposable insulin pen used for the convenient subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of NovoRapid. It has a low injection force, adjustable dial-a-dose setting, a large clear scale and an enhanced color branding that allows you to easily identify what insulin you are using. The FlexPen is easy to learn how to use, with a proven accuracy of dosing, and with its compact size it fits neatly in your purse, bag or pocket.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Weight gain</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Edema</strong></li>\n</ul>\nLow blood sugar, called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hypoglycemia</a>, is the most common side effect of insulin therapy.\n<h4>Some signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>anxiety</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>confusion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>irritability</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>mood changes</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>dizziness</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>headache</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypokalemia is the presence of abnormally low potassium in your blood. All insulin therapies cause a shift in potassium levels that can lead to hypokalemia. If it is left untreated it may cause ventricular arrhythmia, respiratory paralysis, or even death.\n\nWith all injectable therapies, there is the potential for injection site reactions, which may include swelling, pain, redness, bruising, itching, inflammation and hives. Consistent rotation of your injection sites reduces your risk of developing these reactions. These reactions tend to resolve themselves within a few days to weeks. The subcutaneous injection of NovoRapid can also result in localized skin reactions called lipodystrophy. This can present itself as thickening skin or pits of skin at the injection site. Changing your injection technique may help reduce the risk of getting these reactions.\n\nEdema is the swelling caused by fluid retention and may occur with insulin therapy. It can happen in any part of the body; however, its most noticeable in the arms and legs, including the hands, ankles, and feet.\n\nIf you take NovoRapid together with other diabetes medications called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione/"">thiazolidinediones</a> (TZDs), there is the possibility of heart failure, even if you never have had heart issues before. Let your doctor know if you have any symptoms of heart failure which may include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Sudden weight gain</li>\n 	<li>Swelling in your feet or ankles</li>\n 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to use this medication</strong></h2>\nBefore using this <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetes-medications-list/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetes medication</a>, be sure to read the full “Instructions for Use” and use your NovoLog FlexPen exactly as directed by your doctor. NovoRapid is fast-acting, so you should eat a meal within 5 to 10 minutes after taking it. The drug is taken subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. As with all insulin, its absorption, onset and duration of action can be affected by exercise, stress, sickness, or changes in medications or meal patterns.\n\nYour FlexPen should be rotated 180 degrees at least ten times or until it is uniform and cloudy before injection.\n\nAs with all injections, your subcutaneous injection sites should be consistently changed within the same region from one injection to the next to help reduce your risk for lipodystrophy.\n\nIf you are visually impaired, the medication should not be used without the help of a person who has good eyesight and is trained to use it the proper way.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour unique NovoRapid dosing schedule has been created for you specifically by your doctor. Most prescriptions for this medication are made based on your type of diabetes, metabolic needs, blood sugar level monitoring, and history of treatment and use of insulin. Your insulin dose may need to be changed because of changes in weight, increased stress, illness, or change in diet or level of physical activity. You should always carefully monitor your blood sugar levels, particularly if you are switching to NovoLog from another insulin. A long-acting insulin is often used together with NovoLog to help control blood sugar levels between meals and at night time.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not take it if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</li>\n 	<li>You are allergic to any of its ingredients</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tell your doctor if you are:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>Taking a new prescription or an over-the-counter medication, including supplements</li>\n</ul>\nUntil you know how this medication affects you, do not drive or operate machinery.

Insulin aspart is a <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/rapid-acting-insulin-peak-time-onset-brands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fast-acting</a>, man-made insulin that begins to work about 15 minutes after injection and keeps working for three to five hours. These Cartridges are filled with 3 mL of insulin aspart and come in a pack of five.\n<h2><strong>What are they used for?</strong></h2>\nInsulin aspart (NovoLog) is used to help improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes who require insulin for the control of their blood sugar levels. It is commonly used together with a long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin for a full day of insulin protection against high blood sugar levels. These cartridges are specifically designed for use in your insulin injection pen.\n<h2><strong>How do they work?</strong></h2>\nInsulin aspart is genetically manufactured to have a structure that is nearly identical to naturally occurring insulin and, therefore, its mode of action is similar. Insulin is a hormone that is naturally produced in your pancreas, a large organ near your stomach. People who have diabetes either do not produce enough insulin, or their body cannot properly use the insulin it does produce. Insulin is one of the most important compounds in your body for the breakdown of food and the control of your metabolism. It lowers blood sugar levels by allowing for the absorption of sugar from out of the blood and into fat, muscle and liver cells. It also helps lower blood sugar by blocking the production of sugar in the liver and its release into your bloodstream.\n\nInsulin aspart is a fast-acting, or mealtime insulin that works faster and for a shorter amount of time than naturally produced <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/human-insulin-types/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">human insulin</a>. It starts to work approximately 15 minutes after the injection, peaks after about one hour, and continues working for three to five hours more. Due to its short action, insulin aspart is normally taken in combination with an intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin to provide you with insulin protection for the entire day.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low sugar levels in your blood)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Edema</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia, or simply low blood sugar, is the most common side effect of all insulin therapy. Some signs of hypoglycemia include irritability anxiety, sweating, confusion, mood changes, headache and dizziness.\n\nHypokalemia is the medical term for having low potassium levels in your blood. Insulin therapy can cause a shift in potassium levels that, if left untreated, may cause ventricular arrhythmia, respiratory paralysis, and even death.\n\nAs with all injectable therapies there is always the potential for injection site reactions. Some common injection site reactions may include pain, swelling, bruising, redness, itching, hives and inflammation. If you consistently rotate your injection sites, this will reduce your risk of developing these reactions. Subcutaneous injection can also cause skin reactions called lipodystrophy. This can be either lipohypertrophy, which is skin thickening, or lipoatrophy, which is when pits develop at the injection site. Improving your injection technique can help reduce the risk of getting these reactions.\n\nEdema may also occur, which is swelling caused by fluid retention. This may occur with insulin therapy. It can occur in any part of your body, but it is most noticeable in your arms and legs, including your hands, ankles, and feet.\n\nIf you are taking other diabetes medications called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">thiazolidinediones (TZDs)</a> along with NovoRapid, there is a possibility of developing heart failure, even if you never have had heart problems previously. If you have any of the following symptoms of heart failure, let your doctor know immediately:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Shortness of breath</li>\n 	<li>Swelling in your feet or ankles (edema)</li>\n 	<li>Sudden weight gain</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nNovoLog insulin aspart is fast-acting, so you should eat your meals within 5 to 10 minutes after taking it. It is taken through an injection under the skin, which should be administered either in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. Remember to change your injection sites within the same region to help decrease the likelihood of getting any injection site reactions. As with all insulin therapies, the onset, absorption and duration of activity is affected by stress, exercise, sickness, or changes in medications and meal patterns.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour doctor will tell you how much of this medicine you need to use based on your type of diabetes, blood sugar level monitoring, personal metabolic needs, and your history of treatment and use of insulin. It is important to manage your diabetes very carefully. Too much or too little insulin can cause you serious problems. You should always closely monitor your blood sugar levels, especially if you are switching to NovoRapid from another insulin. A longer-acting insulin is recommended to be used together with NovoLog to provide you with insulin protection during the time between doses.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use this insulin if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin aspart, metacresol or any of the other ingredients in the NovoLog vial</li>\n 	<li>Have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</li>\n 	<li>The insulin is not clear and colorless</li>\n 	<li>The cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed</li>\n 	<li>The insulin has not been stored properly or if it has been frozen</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Let your doctor know if you:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have any issues with your kidneys or liver</li>\n 	<li>Are sick</li>\n 	<li>Suffer from diarrhea, vomiting or eat less than usual</li>\n 	<li>Have issues with your pituitary, adrenal or thyroid glands</li>\n 	<li>Drink alcohol</li>\n 	<li>Drive or use tools or machines</li>\n 	<li>Have a fever, infection or have had surgery recently</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant, or planning a pregnancy, or are breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>Are planning to travel over multiple time zones</li>\n 	<li>Are exercising more than usual</li>\n 	<li>Are planning on changing your diet</li>\n</ul>\nThiazolidinediones (TZDs), in combination with the medication in these cartridges, can cause heart failure to develop.

Insulin detemir has been associated with a lower risk of causing weight gain than other man-made insulins.\n\nThe Levemir Penfill is a pre-filled 3 mL glass cartridge designed to be used along with insulin delivery devices such as NovoPen, and for use with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus and NovoTwist needles. Levemir Penfills come with a clear, colorless solution. Each pack contains 5 cartridges of 3 mL.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nLevemir (insulin detemir) is used to help control blood sugar level in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.\n<h3>This insulin has been approved for the treatment of:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes in adults who use insulin for the control of high blood sugar.</li>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes used in combination with liraglutide and metformin.</li>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes in adults when used in combination with other oral anti-diabetic drugs.</li>\n 	<li>Type 1 diabetes in adults, adolescents and children (2 years and older).</li>\n</ul>\nIt is recommended for use together with a fast-acting mealtime insulin to help regulate blood sugar levels throughout the day and night, as well as during and between meals. However, it is not recommended for treating<a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> diabetic ketoacidosis</a> (DKA). Instead, an intravenous fast-acting or <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/short-acting-insulin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">short-acting insulin</a> is the preferred treatment for DKA.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nLevemir (insulin detemir) works by lowering your blood sugar level after injection just like naturally occurring insulin does, only it lasts for a longer period of time. It may last for up to 24 hours, but like all insulin, its duration of action varies according to your dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of physical activity.\n\nNaturally occurring insulin is a hormone normally produced in the beta cells of your pancreas, which controls your metabolism. Levemir works the same as naturally occurring insulin by regulating the breakdown of food such as sugar, fat and protein. It promotes the absorption of sugar from your blood by your fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells. It also blocks your liver’s ability to produce and release sugar back into your blood. Studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes gain less weight taking Levemir than those taking other man-made insulins.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\nLike all medicines, Levemir has the potential to cause some side effects, although not everybody gets them. Taking too much Levemir may cause <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/hypoglycemia-signs-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">low blood sugar</a> (hypoglycemia), which is generally the most common side effect of any insulin product.\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Less common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Rashes</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAlways make sure to closely monitor your blood sugar levels for low or high blood sugar. This is especially important if you change your insulin dose, change your diet, if you begin exercising more or less frequently, if you use other diabetic medications, and particularly if you have any kidney or liver issues. Severe hypoglycemia can be a serious condition that may cause seizures or even death.\n\nInjection site reactions such as swelling, pain, hives, redness, inflammation, itching and bruising may occur. These side effects usually go away after a few weeks of taking your insulin. If they do not disappear, contact your doctor. Other possible reactions around the injection site can include localized lipoatrophy (the localized loss of fat around the injection site), and lipohypertrophy (the accumulation of fat at and around the injection site).\n\nIf signs of allergies appear, or if you begin to suddenly feel unwell, have a rapid heart beat and feel dizzy, you may be experiencing a serious allergic reaction to Levemir or other ingredients in the formulation. Contact your doctor immediately if you think you may be having a serious allergic reaction.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nLevemir is to be taken as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously), never directly into a vein or a muscle. With each injection, make sure to change your injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This reduces the risk of developing injection site reactions, like lumps or skin pitting. The best places to give yourself the injection are in the front of your thighs, the front of your waist (abdomen), or in the upper arm. Levemir will likely work more rapidly if you inject it near your waist. You should always monitor your blood sugar regularly. If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be changed.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nLevemir is usually prescribed based specifically on your body’s own blood sugar response. Monitoring your blood sugar levels is essential when taking Levemir, as well as all insulin products. If you are changing your dose amount or timing of your dose, you should only do so under your doctor’s supervision. If you are treating your type 1 diabetes, Levemir must be used along with a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin.\n\nA typical starting dose, if you have type 1 diabetes, is approximately one-third of your total daily insulin requirement. To meet the rest of your daily insulin requirements, a rapid-acting or short-acting mealtime insulin should be added.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes and you have not been using other oral <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">antidiabetic medications</a>, your recommended starting dose may be 10 units (or 0.1 to 0.2 Units/kg), once a day in the evening or divided into a twice-a-day schedule.\n\nIf you are changing from insulin glargine to Levemir (insulin detemir), the change can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. If you are changing from <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH insulin</a>, the change can also be done on a unit-to-unit basis. Although sometimes patients with type 2 diabetes need more Levemir than NPH insulin.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Do not use it if:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>You feel a hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) reaction coming on</li>\n 	<li>You are allergic or hypersensitive to insulin detemir, metacresol or any of the other ingredients</li>\n 	<li>You are using an insulin infusion pump</li>\n 	<li>The Penfill containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed</li>\n 	<li>The insulin has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen</li>\n 	<li>The insulin is not clear and colorless</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Talk to your doctor about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you</strong>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Have problems with your liver or kidneys, or with your pituitary, adrenal, or thyroid glands</li>\n 	<li>Drink alcohol</li>\n 	<li>Have a fever, infection, or have had surgery</li>\n 	<li>Have diarrhea or vomiting</li>\n 	<li>Eat less than usual, or are planning to change your diet</li>\n 	<li>Exercise more than usual</li>\n 	<li>Are ill</li>\n 	<li>Are traveling across several time zones</li>\n 	<li>Are pregnant, or are hoping to become pregnant</li>\n 	<li>Are breastfeeding</li>\n 	<li>Have low albumin levels</li>\n 	<li>Drive or use tools or machines</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)</a> are a class of oral antidiabetic drugs that when used together with insulin may increase the risk of edema (fluid retention) and heart failure.

6273,simple,,"Levemir FlexTouch Pens 100 Units / mL",1,0,visible,"<h3 class=""productTitle"">Pack with 5 Pens x 3 mL each</h3>","<h2><strong>What is a Levemir FlexTouch Insulin Pen?</strong></h2>\nIt is a pre-filled insulin pen filled with Insulin Detemir, which is a long-acting human insulin analog. <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/insulin-analogs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Insulin analogs</a> are man-made versions of naturally occurring insulin that have been slightly modified to change some of its characteristics. Insulin Detemir is nearly identical to naturally occurring insulin, with a minor modification that allows it to be quickly absorbed in your body then slowly released for a long duration of action. It is a basal, or background insulin that provides blood sugar control evenly for the entire day. Levemir has been associated with having a lower risk of causing weight gain than other insulin analogs.\n\nThe Levemir FlexTouch Pen is a convenient option to administer your insulin. It comes pre-filled with Insulin Detemir and an adjustable dose setting dial for accurate dosing from 1 to 80 units with a large and clear dose display. It also has a low force push button and a lower injection force than other insulin pens. Once opened Levemir can last up to 42 days without refrigeration once in use. The Levemir FlexTouch Pen is available in the 100 unit/mL 5×3 mL pen.\n<h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>\nLevemir (insulin detemir) is used to help improve blood sugar level regulation in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.\n<h3>It is specifically is used for the treatment of:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Type 1 diabetes in adults, adolescents and children who are 2 years old and over</li>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes in adults when insulin is required for the control of high blood sugar</li>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs in adults</li>\n 	<li>Type 2 diabetes in combination with liraglutide and metformin</li>\n</ul>\nIt is recommended for use in combination with a rapid-acting mealtime insulin to help control blood sugar levels all day and night, as well as between and during meals. It is not used for the <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetic-ketoacidosis-symptoms-causes-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis</a> (DKA). An intravenous short- or rapid-acting insulin is the choice treatment type for DKA.\n<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>\nLevemir, or Insulin Detemir works just like naturally occurring insulin does, only longer. It is a <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/long-acting-insulin-names-onset-peak-duration/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">long-acting human insulin</a> analog used for maintaining your basal level of insulin. It is taken as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection under the skin and lasts up to 24 hours with a flat and predictable mode of action.\n\nLike naturally occurring insulin, which is a naturally occurring hormone produced in the pancreas, Levemir works by regulating the breakdown of food such as sugars, fats and proteins. It stimulates the absorption of sugar from the blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells. It also blocks the liver’s ability to produce and release sugar into the blood. Once the sugar is out of your blood, your blood sugar levels decrease and when the sugar is inside your cells, it gives you more energy. Clinical trials with people who have type 2 diabetes have shown that those who took Levemir gained less weight than those taking other insulin analogs.\n<h2><strong>Side effects</strong></h2>\n<h3>Common negative effects may include:</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Allergic reactions</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Injection site reactions, including lipodystrophy</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Rash</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Pruritus (itching)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Diarrhea (if taken with a <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GLP-1 receptor agonist</a>)</strong></li>\n</ul>\nHypoglycemia is a condition of low blood sugar, and is the most common side effect of Levemir. Make sure to closely monitor your blood sugar level, especially if you have to change your insulin dose, use other <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/diabetes-medications-list/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">diabetic medications</a>, change you meal pattern or diet, exercise more or less frequently, and particularly if you have any liver or kidney problems. Severe hypoglycemia may be a life-threatening condition that may cause seizures or even death. It can impair your ability to concentrate and can slow your reaction time down, which can effect your ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\nPossible reactions in and around the injection site can include localized lipodystrophy, or lipoatrophy which the localized loss of fat around the injection site, and lipohypertrophy which is the accumulation of fat at and around the injection site. Other localized skin reactions may include itching, redness and swelling at the injection site.\n<h2><strong>How to take this medication</strong></h2>\nLevemir is taken as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. As with all insulin, its absorption, onset and duration of action, can be affected by exercise, stress, sickness, or changes in medications or meal patterns. If you use Levemir once a day you should administer your dose with your evening meal or at bed time. If you require twice a day dosing you can administer your evening dose with your evening meal, at bed time, or 12 hours following your morning dose. As with all insulin, your injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, thigh, or shoulder) from one injection to the next to help reduce your risk for lipodystrophy.\n\nDo not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution and never inject Levemir into a vein or muscle.\n<h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2>\nYour dose of Levemir must be personalized based on your body’s blood sugar response. Carefully monitoring your blood sugar level is essential for all patients who are on insulin therapy. If you are adjusting your timing or amount of dose, you should only do so with your doctor’s consent and with careful blood sugar monitoring. Levemir must be used together with rapid- or <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/short-acting-insulin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">short-acting insulin</a> if you have type 1 diabetes.\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes the recommended initial dose of should be about 1/3 of your total daily insulin needs. A short-acting or rapid-acting, mealtime insulin should be added used to meet the rest of your daily insulin needs.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes which hasn’t been controlled by <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/oral-antidiabetic-drugs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class="""">oral antidiabetic medications</span></a>, your recommended starting dose is 10 Units (or 0.1 to 0.2 Units/kg) taken once a day in the evening or split up into two times a day.\n\nIf you are switching from insulin glargine your change may be made on a unit to unit basis. If you are switching from <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nph-insulin/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NPH insulin</a>, your change may also be made on a unit to unit basis. Although sometimes people with type 2 diabetes can need more Levemir insulin than NPH insulin.\n<h2><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong></h2>\nBefore taking Levemir, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including if you are:\n<ul>\n 	<li>taking new prescription or over -the-counter medicines, including supplements</li>\n 	<li>pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant</li>\n 	<li>breastfeeding.</li>\n</ul>\nNever share your Levemir FlexTouch with anyone, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a significant risk for the transmission of infections.\n\nCareful blood sugar monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary if you have kidney or liver troubles. Some drugs may change your insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).\n\nFluid retention (edema) and heart failure can occur if you use drugs called <a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/can-expect-taking-thiazolidinedione/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">thiazolidinediones</a> (TZDs) along with insulin, including Levemir. You should be be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If you do get any signs of heart failure, you may have to reduce your dose, or stop taking TZDs altogether.\n\nDo not drink alcohol or take medicines that contain alcohol, and do not drive or operate heavy machinery, until you know how it affects you.\n<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>\n<a href=""https://canadianinsulin.com/"">CanadianInsulin.com</a> will provide the lowest price for Levemir FlexTouch Pens from Canada.
