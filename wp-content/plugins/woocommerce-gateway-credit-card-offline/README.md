WooCommerce Offline Credit Card Processing
==========================================

This payment gateway for WooCommerce allows your customers to enter their credit card information on your site and let you process the data manually (offline) using your payment terminal. To make this process secure, only the first and the last four digits are saved to the database while the middle digits and the security code are sent to a dedicated email address so that the complete credit card number is never stored on a single computer.
